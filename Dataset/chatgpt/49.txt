The number of overweight children in developed countries has been steadily increasing in recent years. This is a worrying trend, and there is much debate over the causes of this issue. Some people point to the growing number of fast food outlets as the root cause, while others blame the parents for not taking enough responsibility for their children's health. In my opinion, both of these views have some merit and should be taken into consideration.

On the one hand, it is hard to deny that the proliferation of fast food outlets has played a role in the increasing number of overweight children. Fast food is generally high in fat and sugar, and can be a very unhealthy choice for children. Furthermore, fast food outlets often market their products to children, making it even more difficult for parents to ensure their children are eating healthily. Therefore, it is clear that the growing number of fast food outlets has had a negative impact on the health of children in developed countries.

On the other hand, it is important to remember that parents are ultimately responsible for the health of their children. If parents are not making healthy food choices for their children, or not encouraging them to exercise, then this can lead to children becoming overweight. In addition, parents should be aware of the potential dangers of fast food and ensure their children are not consuming too much of it. Therefore, it is fair to say that the parents should take some responsibility for the health of their children.

In conclusion, while I believe that the growing number of fast food outlets has had an impact on the number of overweight children in developed countries, it is also important to recognize that parents should be doing more to ensure their children's health. Both of these views should be taken into consideration in order to address this worrying trend.
