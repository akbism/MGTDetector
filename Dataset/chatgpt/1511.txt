In today’s age, technology has become an indispensable part of human life. It is undeniable that we are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. Computers have transitioned from being merely a tool of leisure, to taking over critical roles in almost every corner of our lives. For instance, they have become a necessity in businesses, hospitals, even playing a role in crime detection and piloting a plan. 

Due to the presence of these sharp instruments, work that would have otherwise been extremely time consuming, can be done in a fraction of the time. In businesses, computers help in streamlining many processes and keeping track of inventory. For instance, warehouses use automated systems to track shipments, or to create work orders. Similarly, hospitals use data from patient records and computers to help diagnose diseases or provide medical consultation to patients remotely. 

In the field of criminal investigation, computer’s aid crime detection. Data from facial recognition, fingerprints, or vehicle registration can be used to identify suspects in a very short period of time. Apart from these, computer’s have also enabled the automation of airplanes. They known to be efficient and safe as pilots can be assisted by the technology to fly an airplane without the need of manual labour. 

Though the history of computer’s has only been brief, its effects have been instrumental in the success of many domains. Given computers’ strong role in our lives, it is no surprise that people have become increasingly reliant on computers. Thus, they are here to stay and will continue to be a part of our lives.
