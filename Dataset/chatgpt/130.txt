Retirement age is a highly debated topic in today’s society. The retirement age is the age at which an individual is expected to stop working and is generally set by the government. The age at which people should be made to retire is a complex issue and there is no single answer to it. 

The age at which people should be made to retire largely depends on the individual’s career and health. For example, those working in physically demanding jobs such as construction workers, manual laborers, and factory workers may need to retire earlier than those in less strenuous jobs. This is because physically demanding jobs can take a toll on their health, leading to a decrease in productivity. 

On the other hand, those in less strenuous jobs may be able to continue working for longer as their health is not as affected. This means that they can continue to contribute to the economy and society for longer. Furthermore, some people may be able to continue working well into their 70s or even 80s if their health allows them to do so. 

In addition, the retirement age should also be based on an individual’s financial situation. Some people may not have enough savings to support themselves after retirement, so they may need to continue working for longer in order to build up enough savings. 

In conclusion, it is difficult to set a single retirement age for everyone as it largely depends on the individual’s career and health, as well as their financial situation. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors when deciding on the retirement age.
