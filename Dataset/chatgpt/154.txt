In recent years, the gap between the rich and the poor nations has widened significantly. This has raised the question of whether wealthy nations should be obligated to share their wealth with poorer nations. On one hand, it is argued that wealthy nations should be required to provide basic necessities such as food and education to the poorer nations. On the other hand, some people argue that it is the responsibility of the governments of the poorer nations to look after their citizens. In my opinion, wealthy nations should be obligated to share their wealth with poorer nations, however, the governments of the poorer nations should also take responsibility for their citizens.

To begin with, wealthy nations should be obligated to share their wealth with poorer nations. The citizens of the poorer nations are often deprived of basic necessities such as food and education due to poverty. By providing these necessities, wealthy nations can help the citizens of the poorer nations to lead a better life. Moreover, it can also help to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor nations by providing the poor nations with the necessary resources.

On the other hand, it is also important to note that the governments of the poorer nations should also take responsibility for their citizens. The governments of the poorer nations should take steps to improve the living conditions of their citizens. They should create job opportunities and provide access to healthcare and education. This will help to improve the living standards of the citizens of the poorer nations and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor nations.

In conclusion, it is my belief that wealthy nations should be obligated to share their wealth with poorer nations. However, the governments of the poorer nations should also take responsibility for their citizens by creating job opportunities and providing access to healthcare and education. This can help to improve the living standards of the citizens of the poorer nations and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor nations.
