News editors are those in charge of deciding what to broadcast on television, radio, and print in newspapers. In most cases, news editors are responsible for collecting news stories, writing headlines, and having stories ready for when the news broadcast goes live. With the vast plethora of events, happenings, and news reports from around the world, editors must make decisions that reflect their values, goals, and ideals while still being impartial and presenting the facts. 

Naturally, there is pressure when it comes to making such decisions. Editors are tasked with discerning what news is important, how to package it, and where to prioritize it in the program or issue. That isn’t to say there are no guidelines in place, as journalistic ethics such as verification of facts and informing the public with accurate information remain integral parts of news editors’ job descriptions. 

Furthermore, it is debatable as to what influences news editors’ decisions when it comes to choosing stories to print or broadcast. Depending on the circumstances, teams of editors may have more leeway in covering stories that may not carry a high degree of public interest, but nevertheless have some merit. For example, a regional story that may have significant importance for a small area could be featured. Ultimately, a number of elements—the regional news editors’ values, what the public is interested in, space and time allocated for news stories, the attention to accuracy, and more—may dictate whether a story makes the cut or not. 

In regards to whether we have become used to bad news, this can be corroborated; for instance, part of why journalists often focus on negativity is because it often grabs public attention more easily than positive stories. At the same time, it can be argued that stories with a positive spin and happy endings can provide solace and hope to people, which proves that not all stories need to come with a dark conclusion. 

Considering the matter of whether more good news should be reported, the answer is a definitive yes. By elucidating the good that happens alongside bad news, the media created a rounded narrative that provides the public with a sense of positivity in the form of encouragement. It is essential that the moral courage of society be highlighted with news stories that, even in an era as tumultuous as ours, have happy and/or productive resolutions, as this is likely to inspire a sense of hope for people around the world. 

In conclusion, news editors are faced with a multitude of decisions to make, from pressing international stories to local events, which often come with a degree of pressure and speculation as to what ultimately gets broadcast. Even with factors in play, there is evidence that good news is welcomed just as much as bad news, and there should definitely be consideration put towards reporting more positive stories, as this carries benefits to viewers and readers.
