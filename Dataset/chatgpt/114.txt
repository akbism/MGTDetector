Nowadays, the availability of ready-made and easy to prepare food has made life much easier for people. This has changed the way we live and the way we cook our meals. 

The most obvious benefit of easy to prepare food is the convenience it provides. It is much easier to pick up a pre-made meal or cook something with minimal preparation than it is to cook a full meal from scratch. This has allowed people to save time, as they can now easily prepare meals in a fraction of the time it used to take to cook a full meal. This extra time can be used to pursue other interests or just relax. 

Another benefit is the variety of food that is now available. Ready-made meals and easy to prepare ingredients have allowed people to access a much wider range of food than before. This has allowed people to experiment and explore different types of cuisine, which can be a great way to broaden their culinary horizons. 

Additionally, these food options are often much healthier than the traditional home-cooked meals. Ready-made meals are generally lower in fat and calories than home-cooked meals, and they also usually contain fewer preservatives and additives. This has allowed people to eat healthier without having to spend extra time and effort in the kitchen. 

However, there are some drawbacks to this change in the way we prepare food. One is that it may lead to a lack of cooking skills, as people are no longer required to cook from scratch. This could lead to a lack of understanding of basic nutrition and the importance of a balanced diet. Additionally, ready-made meals tend to be more expensive than home-cooked meals, which can be a burden for those on a budget. 

Overall, the availability of easy to prepare food has changed the way we live and has allowed us to save time and money. It has also given us access to a wider variety of food, which can be a great way to explore different types of cuisine. However, it is important to remember the importance of basic cooking skills and nutrition and to be aware of the potential drawbacks of relying too heavily on ready-made meals.
