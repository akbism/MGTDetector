Humans have been using land for various purposes since time immemorial. While it is true that land is essential for housing, industry, and agriculture, it is equally important to save land for endangered animals. I disagree with the view that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals.

Firstly, land is essential for the survival of many animal species. Endangered animals need land for their habitat, to look for food, and to breed. For example, the Bengal tiger is facing extinction due to the destruction of its natural habitat. If we do not save land for endangered animals, their numbers will continue to decline and they may eventually become extinct.

Secondly, conserving land for endangered animals can be beneficial to humans in the long run. Endangered animals play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance. For instance, the honey bee is an endangered species that is essential for pollination and thus, for the production of food. If we do not save land for them, it will have a negative impact on food production and may lead to food insecurity in the future.

Finally, saving land for endangered animals is not mutually exclusive to the needs of humans. We can easily find a balance between the two. For instance, we can set aside protected areas for endangered animals, while also providing land for housing, industry, and agriculture. This way, we can ensure the survival of endangered animals while also fulfilling human needs.

In conclusion, it is important to save land for endangered animals, as it is essential for their survival and also has long-term benefits for humans. We must find a balance between the needs of humans and the needs of endangered animals, in order to ensure a sustainable future for both.
