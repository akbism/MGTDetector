Nowadays, traffic and housing problems in major cities are becoming more and more serious, and people have proposed various solutions to this problem. One of the solutions is to move large companies and factories and their employees to the countryside. However, I do not fully agree with this opinion.

On the one hand, moving large companies and factories to the countryside could help to reduce the traffic congestion in major cities. This is because fewer people will be commuting to and from work, and this in turn will lead to fewer cars on the roads, thus reducing the amount of traffic. Moreover, the relocation of factories and companies would also help to reduce the amount of air pollution in major cities, as the factories would be producing their goods in the countryside, away from the cities.

On the other hand, I do not think that this solution would be effective in solving the housing problems in major cities. Even if the factories and companies were moved to the countryside, the employees would still need to live in the cities, as they would need to be close to their workplaces. This means that the demand for housing in the cities would still remain high, and the housing prices would not go down. Furthermore, the relocation of factories and companies to the countryside would bring about a lot of disruption to the lives of the employees, as they would have to move away from their homes and families.

In conclusion, while relocating large companies and factories to the countryside could help to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution in major cities, it would not be an effective solution to the housing problems in these cities.
