The debate regarding the major influence on our personality and development has been ongoing for many years. While some argue that our experiences in life have a greater impact on our development, research indicates that the characteristics we are born with are much more influential. In my opinion, the major influence on our personality and development is the characteristics we are born with. 

The primary reason for my opinion is that our genetic makeup determines our physical and mental characteristics. This is particularly evident in the case of physical traits such as height, weight and eye color, which are determined by our genes. Similarly, our mental characteristics such as intelligence, creativity and emotional stability are also largely determined by our genetic makeup. These characteristics form the foundation of our personality and have a significant impact on our development. For example, an individual with a higher level of intelligence is more likely to succeed in school and in their career than someone with a lower level of intelligence.

In addition, the characteristics we are born with can also influence our behavior. For instance, an individual who is born with a predisposition to be aggressive is more likely to engage in aggressive behavior than someone who is not. Similarly, an individual who is born with a predisposition to be shy is more likely to be introverted than someone who is not. These behavioral tendencies are largely determined by our genetic makeup and can have a significant impact on our personality and development. 

On the other hand, while our experiences in life can also have an impact on our personality and development, they are not as influential as the characteristics we are born with. For example, an individual who is born with a predisposition to be shy may become more extroverted as a result of positive experiences in life. However, this is not likely to happen if the individual is not born with the predisposition to be extroverted in the first place. In other words, our experiences in life can only have a limited influence on our personality and development.

In conclusion, while our experiences in life can have some influence on our personality and development, the major influence is the characteristics we are born with. Our genetic makeup determines our physical and mental characteristics, which form the foundation of our personality and have a significant impact on our development. Therefore, it is clear that the major influence on our personality and development is the characteristics we are born with.
