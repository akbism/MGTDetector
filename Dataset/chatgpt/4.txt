When it comes to learning about life, there are two distinct approaches: taking the advice of family and friends, or learning through personal experience. Both of these approaches have their own advantages, and it is difficult to determine which one is preferable. 

On the one hand, taking advice from family and friends can be beneficial as it provides us with a perspective that is not our own. Advice from family and friends can be tailored to our individual situation, and can be based on their own personal experiences. This can be especially valuable when we are feeling overwhelmed and need guidance from someone who is more experienced. Additionally, having the support of family and friends can help to give us the confidence to take risks and make decisions. 

On the other hand, learning through personal experience can be equally valuable. Making mistakes and learning from them is an important part of life, and can help us to become more independent and confident in our own judgement. Through personal experience, we can gain a better understanding of our own values and beliefs, and this can be invaluable in helping us to make decisions. 

In conclusion, both taking advice from family and friends and learning through personal experience have their own advantages. Ultimately, the best way of learning about life is to make use of both of these approaches. By combining the perspective of those close to us with our own experiences, we can gain a better understanding of life and make more informed decisions.
