Nowadays, advertising plays a huge part in our lives. There are those who believe that advertisements encourages consumers to buy unnecessary things, while others say that it is beneficial in informing us of new and innovative products available. My stance is that while advertising can be persuasive, it ultimately informs us on potential products and services that could enhance our lives.

To begin with, advertising is created and presented in a way that is often persuasive and attractive to consumers and it is due to this that some people suggest it can leave people buying things that they do not need. This can be seen especially in supermarkets, for instance, where big bold signs and colourful images lure consumers in, creating impulse buying. Undoubtedly, this does occur and to some extent, consumers can be misled into purchasing something that they may regret later. Tablets and smartphones, for example, are advertised regularly claiming to be the “best” version currently available, despite this often not being the case.

On the other hand, there are those that would argue advertising is beneficial in informing individuals of products and services that they may not have been aware of. As technology advances, so do the products and services available. Advertising is a great way to make people aware of such advancements and allows them to invest in updated versions that may in fact benefit them; such as phones being advertised as ‘water resistant’ or laundry detergents being advertised as ‘environmentally friendly’. Having this knowledge provides an opportunity for people to take advantage of such advancements, as it is highly unlikely for one to stumble across such a product or service.

In conclusion, I definitely agree with the view that advertising brings to light potentially beneficial products and services. While it is possible that advertisement can be persuasive in creating impulse buying, it can also be viewed as a positive way to educate the public of modern and innovative products. People can use this information to their advantage, being sure to do their research and shop responsibly.
