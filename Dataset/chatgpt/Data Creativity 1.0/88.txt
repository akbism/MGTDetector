When people are confronted with the prospect of migration to another country, some choose to assimilate into their new home by embracing the culture, customs and traditions of the new country. Others, however, choose to keep the customs from their homeland and find it difficult to depart from their habitual practices and traditions. As I am a firm believer in keeping my own customs, I prefer this second option. 

People who adopt the customs of a new country are doing so out of respect for the country and its inhabitants. This is a commendable attitude, and reflects the type of cultural understanding that bolsters communication and creates a more united bond between citizens. Moreover, if people are integrating into their new home, they are likely to develop a stronger connection with their environment, allowing them to become a productive functioning member of their host country. 

The other alternative—retaining one’s own cultural customs—is also essential to human development, for culture is one of the most basic and influential components of our lives. We learn the customs of our homeland from our families, peers, and surroundings, and we use them to give structure to our daily lives. Keeping our cherished cultural customs creates a sense of continuity and familiarity which we find grounding. These customs can also help us to remember our homeland, from which we might feel nostalgia or longing. It can cause us to be more understanding and tolerant of our ancestry, and lets us know that we are connected to lost traditions, places, and people. 

In conclusion, I prefer keeping my own customs despite the temptations of assimilating. This softer way of integration allows us to embrace our origins while also contributing positively to our newfound home.
