It is generally accepted that both physical activity and academic pursuits are important for providing a well-rounded education to students. Unfortunately, in recent times, sports and exercise classes are increasingly being replaced with extra academic classes as institutions focus on academic excellence alone. This trend can have both positive and negative impacts on students, but ultimately, it is important to prioritize physical activity to ensure students lead a healthy and balanced life.

One positive effect of this trend is that students may be able to excel academically and, in turn, have opportunities to pursue higher education. This increased emphasis on academics may lead to improved performances, higher qualifications, and greater chances of entry into prestigious institutions of learning. However, there is an underlying danger of students becoming increasingly stressed and overburdened as a result of sitting too many exams and completing endless assignments.

On the other hand, the decision to prioritize academic interests can have negative effects on students. An obvious drawback is that students miss out on the many physical and social benefits of participating in sport. Not only do sports help improve physical wellbeing, they also offer an excellent avenue to engage with other students and build teamwork skills. It is these skills that are highly sought after in many industries today.

In conclusion, it is important that physical activities are given the same amount of attention as academics. Having an equal balance of the two would ensure students receive the best possible education. Ultimately, it is up to educational institutions to prioritize physical activities and make it compulsory for students to agree to physical exercises as part of their education. Doing so would help ensure students feel healthy, socially engaged and eventually become successful in both academics and in life.
