Food has been an intrinsic part of human life since evolving from the Stone Age. It is easy to assume that the drastic changes in food preparation over the years have no effect on our daily lives. However, the improvements in food technology have a positive effect on human life and have made life easier and more comfortable. 

In the past, food was prepared manually in a laborious process which was both time consuming and energy draining. This made it difficult to prepare nutritious meals with various ingredients. Quality could not be assured and there was a lack of diversity in the food options available. In addition, transport, storage and preservation were major problems in maintaining quality. As a result, people had to resort to food that was unhealthy or spoiled often.

Since the industrial revolution, food production and preparation have taken a turn for the better by becoming much easier and faster. There have been significant advances in food processing and packaging. Food can now be cooked quickly without compromising on the nutritional content. Also, there is a greater variety of food available, as fresh ingredients can easily be transported and stored. Technology has also made it possible to substitute ingredients. As a result, healthier and more diversified diets are now accessible to all. 

Moreover, prepared meals can be frozen and reheated, which eliminates the need to spend hours in the kitchen daily. Meal kits deliver pre-portioned ingredients, making it easier to cook with minimal fuss. This has been a great source of convenience and comfort to busy working professionals. It has also motivated households to learn new cooking skills and try their hands at various cuisines. 

To conclude, the improvements in food technology have made our lives easier and more comfortable. We are now able to enjoy a balanced and nutritious diet with better quality and variety than ever before. Prepared meals eliminate the hassle of daily cooking and save a substantial amount of time. Thus, it can be said that the change has been entirely positive in improving the lifestyle of society.
