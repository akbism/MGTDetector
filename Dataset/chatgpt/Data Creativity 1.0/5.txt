Education is essential for a person's healthy development, and generally it consists of both academic and non-academic subjects. Academic subjects are essential, but there is an argument whether non-academic subjects should be removed from the syllabus, so that the students can focus wholly on their academic studies. I, however, disagree with this idea, as I firmly believe that these non-academic activities are essential for their personal and social growth.

Firstly, physical education activities, such as sports and games, are of great significance for the physical and mental growth of the students. These activities have been shown to improve overall physical coordination, flexibility, and strength of the body, which are essential for a healthy and fit lifestyle. At the same time, physical sports can also help the students to be more proactive and energetic in learning, enabling them to excel in their academic studies.

In addition, non-academic subjects, like cooking and craftwork, can be helpful for the students in their personal growth. Learning such subjects is important for personal development, as it provides them with the skills they will need later in life, such as cooking and basic repairs around the home. A practical understanding of such skills can prove to be beneficial when the student is out of school and needs to take on personal household chores.

Finally, social activity based programmes, like theatre and public speaking, can give the students exposure to different abilities and teaching styles. They learn to appreciate different cultures, surroundings and social networks, understanding how to interact better with others in different situations. This not only helps them in their personal development, but also when it comes to working in groups and completing tasks efficiently.

To conclude, I strongly disagree with the idea that non-academic subjects should be removed from the syllabus, as such activities are an important part of the student's development and gives them important practical and social skills. Not only does focusing on these activities help with physical growth, but it also helps in developing team dynamics, understanding real-world situations, and achieving personal goals.
