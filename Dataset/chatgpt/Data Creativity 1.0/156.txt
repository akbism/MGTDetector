The ever-increasing gap between the 1st world countries and the 3rd world countries is a huge issue and something needs to be done about it. This wealth gap has done a lot of harm to the less privileged countries and needs an immediate solution. 

There are several ways by which the wealth gap between these countries can be reduced. For example, providing better employment, education opportunities, and stable government policies. Developed nations have the responsibility to help the less developed countries in any way they can. They should assist in improving the standards of living of the less fortunate countries by providing them with more assistance in terms of resources and education, as well as investments and development plans. 

One of the most important steps towards reducing this wealth gap is the implementation of effective trade policies. Developed countries should strive to reduce the disparities between their countries’ and the less fortunate countries’ economies through trade policies that generate mutual benefits. This means that the rich nations should open up to the goods and services of the poor countries which in turn, would help in providing jobs and livelihoods. This can even be taken a step further by investing in these countries, so that they can benefit from the technology and resources that may already be present in these countries.

Moreover, developed countries should also encourage foreign aid and philanthropic investments from organizations, so that poorer countries can be provided with much needed assistance.  Foreign aid and investments should be used to improve the health, education and infrastructure of weaker countries. Ultimately, this should lead to improvements in the standard of living and a reduction in poverty. 

The major responsibility usually falls on the wealthy countries to take the lead and drive changes in bridging the wealth gap between rich and poor countries. The wealthier countries have the responsibility to identify issues and find solutions to bridge the wealth gap. If these steps are implemented diligently, the wealth gap between rich and poor countries can be reduced significantly.
