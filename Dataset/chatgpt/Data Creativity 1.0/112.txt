As the world of fashion is constantly changing and adapting, it is hard for individuals to keep up with the latest fashion trends. While most people would argue that these fashion trends exist for the primary purpose of selling clothes, some might argue that one should wear what they like and feel comfortable in rather than following the trends. I personally agree with the latter opinion to a certain extent and believe that fashion trends should not be the sole factor determining how people dress. 

In today's day and age, it is important to express oneself as much as possible, which includes through one's dress sense. Clothes are one of the most visible forms of expression and it is crucial to feel good in one's own clothing. From my own experience, I can say that when I bought clothes that I liked and felt comfortable in, I ended up feeling very confident in them. Thus, I believe that when it comes to the way people dress, more emphasis should be placed on finding clothes that one likes and feels comfortable in, regardless of what the latest fashion trends are. 

That said, I believe one can be fashionable without following trends. There are some fashion staples that tend to remain in style regardless of what is trending and adding some of these to one's wardrobe can help create a timeless and classic look. For example, jeans with a nice shirt and cardigan or tailored trousers with a crisp white shirt are some classic fashion combinations that can help you achieve a fashionable yet comfortable look. Another way to stay fashionable without strictly adhering to trends is to recreate a classic look with some modern twists. For example, taking a classic plain white t-shirt and pairing it with culottes and statement earrings can create a modern, stylish look without having to follow a fashion trend. 

In conclusion, while there are certain fashion trends that are always in style, I believe that when it comes to dressing up one should focus on finding clothes that they like and feel comfortable in and not feel pressured to follow the latest trends. One can be fashionable without strictly following trends and should choose to dress in a way that best expresses their personality.
