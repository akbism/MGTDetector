Agreeing that children are typically better than adults when it comes to learning new things is a widespread assumption. Because they are young, they often have greater enthusiasm and a shorter decision-making time when it comes to taking on new information. Additionally, young children are often seen as possessing greater energy, attention span, and eagerness to explore. It is also thought that children learn at higher rates than adults because they have better memories. 

However, there are valid arguments that suggest adults can learn more quickly than children in certain situations. Adults have the benefit of a breadth of life experience that can serve as a source of instruction and an advantage in learning something quickly. Furthermore, adults tend to have better problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, which can be a great help when learning complex topics. Additionally, adults are usually more focused when it comes to tasks and less likely to become easily distracted. 

Thus, there is no definite answer when it comes to the debate on whether children learn more quickly than adults. Both sides have amount of evidence to support their argument and different subjects may require different learning approaches. It has been argued that in situations where memorization is needed, children may have a slight advantage over adults. However, in situations that requires problem-solving and critical thinking, adults have the edge. Ultimately, it seems that both parties can have an advantage depending on the situation.
