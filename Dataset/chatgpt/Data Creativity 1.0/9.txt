As the saying goes ‘you are the reflection of your company’ and it truly stands true in the case of students in school. Disruptive students can have a negative influence on the other students of the school and for that reason, some people advocate for them being segregated from the rest. They argue that these students should be grouped together and taught separately. My opinion is slightly different as segregating these students from the rest would not solve the core problem and it has some drawbacks.

Firstly, it is not justifiable to group the disruptive students together and teach them separately because they are not required to learn in isolation. Every student has equal right to learn in a friendly, safe and encouraging environment and isolating them would violate their basic rights. Moreover, we must remember that these students are disruptive, not because they are made up of bad genes, but due to the manner in which they are raised or the environment they are grown up in. Thus, segregating them from the rest would do very little to change their behavior.

Secondly, it would be a challenge if these students are grouped together and taught separately, as the teaching curriculum then would have to be adjusted so that it caters the need of students of all kinds. On top of that, it is more difficult for teachers to hold the attention of a bunch of disruptive students, rather than a class full of attentive students.

Finally, by segregating disruptive students and teaching them separately, we might hinder the growth of other students. As a result of which, they may not be able to gain knowledge of co-existence and tolerance, which are key teaching tools that they should learn while growing up.

To sum up, I believe segregating disruptive students and teaching them separately is not a viable solution, however it is necessary to deal with the core problem which is the lack of discipline among them.
