The increasing dependence on computers has been revolutionizing various spheres of life, from businesses to health care to crime detection. As technology keeps developing, the scope of computer applications is advancing at a rapid pace, and thus it is not far-fetched to assume that in the future, computers may be used to do far more complex tasks than today. The issue of whether this dependence on computers is a good thing or not is a complex one that requires a considerable amount of consideration.

On the one hand, the benefits of relying on computers to do intricate tasks are evident. Machines are not just faster, but also far more accurate in undertaking many high-level operations. This undoubtedly saves a great deal of time and effort which can be invested in more meaningful tasks. Moreover, computers are not capable of the same kind of human biases which may influence outcomes, thus making them ideal for sensitive roles like those in judiciary and health care.

On the other hand, relying too heavily on computers to make decisions with life-changing consequences can be dangerous. Firstly, machines are no substitute for human creativity, emotion, and intuition. Human decisions that are made with a consideration of all these elements may be far more effective. Additionally, the chances of computer hacking or malfunctioning make the outcomes of computer-handled operations suspect. These risks make manual intervention much more desirable in some high-stakes situations.

In conclusion, the dependence on computers in the present or the future is a complex issue that requires further consideration. The benefits of computer-handled operations are many, but at the same time, the risks associated with machines performing intricate tasks cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is imperative to develop appropriate safeguards and regulation so that technology can be used without sacrificing safety and security.
