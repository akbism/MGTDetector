The first thing that comes to mind when talking about television and the impact it has had on our society is the debate of whether the effect is positive or negative. The effects of television are varied and far-reaching and it is important to consider both the positive and negative influences on our culture. 

To measure the positive effects, we can look to the many educational programs that provide viewers with knowledge in fields such as science, mathematics, and history. Educational television has become an integral part of school curriculums and has been proven to enhance classroom learning. Additionally, television can help bring issues to light in a way that no other medium can. It has the power to educate, inform, and inspire individuals to create tangible change. 

On the other hand, however, the negative effects of television must not be disregarded. In particular, it can influence the moral values of society by having a pernicious effect on the youth, with programmes that often contain violence, sex, and/or drugs portraying them as acceptable. Furthermore, television viewers, who spend countless hours focusing on the personalities of celebrities and obsessing over them, often lose sight of their own aspirations and set unrealistic goals for themselves that can have destructive consequences. 

In my opinion, television has, on balance, been a positive influence on the development of my societyâ€™s culture. Programs have been instrumental in providing a platform for important issues to be discussed, ideas to be shared, and knowledge to be gained. This has built a stronger sense of community in our society, through improved and more open communication, making us more accepting of our differences. 

All in all, it is safe to say that television has become an inseparable part of our culture and will continue to shape it for years to come.  It is therefore important to remember that television can be an incredibly powerful tool and its contents must continue to be carefully regulated and managed, to ensure that the effects are primarily positive and constructive.
