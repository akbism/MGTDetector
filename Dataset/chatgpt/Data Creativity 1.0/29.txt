Due to technological advancement, the internet has created a global platform where people can freely communicate with each other and bridge the gap between different countries and cultures. The internet provides the opportunity to stay connected around the world, without any limitations of space or time. From the standpoint of communication, it is difficult to deny that the internet has served as a means of bringing people together. 

The most common form for communications over the internet are text messages, emails, social media and electronic calls. With the help of such tools, people from various countries can remain in contact with each other. One of the advantages of the internet is that communication has become more efficient and cost-effective. For example, instead of spending on costly international call rates, one can connect with friends and family at the click of a button. Moreover, talking discounts, coupons and rewards available on these applications makes them more attractive for users. 

The internet also provides virtual access to events. Individuals can attend events happening in another part of the world without being physically present. These activities may include conferences, webinars and meetups. This helps in broadening perspectives as people get exposed to new ideas and cultures. 

To conclude, the internet is undoubtedly making the world smaller. It has connected people all around the globe within seconds and enabled them to interact without any geographical boundaries. Thus, it is undeniable that the internet is helping people to communicate more easily with each other.
