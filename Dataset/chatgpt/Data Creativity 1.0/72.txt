It is an undeniable fact that old age brings tremendous changes in one's life and mostly weaker and vulnerable individuals' finds themselves in an unenviable situation. When someone gets older, and no one is there to look after them, they often opt to stay in homes, like elderly care facilities. In this kind of homes, many old people live under the same roof, and there are trained staff and nurses to look after them properly. However, a pertinent question has alarmed the society: who must take the responsibility of taking care of seniors? 

As far as the responsibility of taking care of the elderly people is concerned, our society should be primarily responsible to provide reliable aid and assistance to old people. If one studies the statistics and surveys like WHO, it will become clear that in most of the countries, the government pays for elderly care. But, the government alone cannot be solely responsible for this task. There are limited resources available to them, and due to their various obligations, the government cannot devote its entire focus on elderly care. Hence, in an economically feasible, the community is obligated to share the responsibilities. 

The entire society must acknowledge the importance of elderly care. Especially, a family where the older citizens belong, must be absolutely liable for providing medical attention, love and proper support to their parents. They have moral commitment to manage the financial support, and organize better living conditions of the seniors. Moreover, as per the socio-cultural norms, it should also be a responsibility of the family to devote time to the elderly members. Consequently, this would not only provide the old individuals a sense of security, but also help them connect to the family despite their age. 

In addition, non-government organisations can also chip in their efforts to ensure the elderly care. It is necessary for these organisations to create awareness about elderly peopleâ€™s needs in the society. This effort can also target the youngsters and engage them as volunteers, who can spend some time with the elderly. They can also organise various activities where people can join and help out the elderly people. 

In conclusion, I believe that elderly care is a collective responsibility of society, government and families. If each one of us will our bit to make sure the elderly individuals stay healthy and happy, our society will surely become a better place to live.
