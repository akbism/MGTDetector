Undoubtedly, paid employment for young children has traditionally been seen as a morally contested topic. On one hand, some people argue that it provides children with a valuable work experience, allowing them to begin to learn the skill of financial responsibility. On the other hand, it can also be seen as morally wrong since childrenâ€™s skin has not been developed enough to cope with the pressures of employed life. 

My opinion leans more towards the latter view - that it is wrong on more than one level. Firstly, a child's primary responsibility should be to their academic studies and personal development, not to a paycheck; depriving a child of the free time that all of us have enjoyed in our youths would deprive them of so many of life's education that can only be experienced outside of the work environment. Secondly, a work environment for children can be exploitative for two reasons. Firstly, it is a small amount of money for a large amount of hours, and also puts them in vulnerable positions. Young people are sometimes hired without a contract, can be fired without any explanation and may find it hard to stand up to bosses and co-workers. 

However, it is important to recognise that, in certain cases, paid employment for children can be a positive experience. Work may provide young people with the skills and confidence to gain a better understanding of the world. Also, in an unequal world, sometimes the only way to make money is through work, and young people can provide much-needed additional income to their family.

To conclude, I would argue that, whilst paid employment for children in certain cases can be beneficial, more often than not it is morally wrong and therefore should not be allowed, especially in the workplace. Children deserve to have a free and safe environment where they can grow and learn, and can be shaped into successful adults in their own right.
