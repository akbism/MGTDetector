Nowadays, smoking is one of the most serious problems in society, as it can bring with it numerous health complications and has rightly been prohibited in public places in many countries. Although the decision to smoke is an individual's personal choice, smokers should realise that the consequences of their decision might be costly and should thus expect to pay more for medical treatment compared to nonsmokers. 

It goes without saying that it is the responsibility of a smoker to accept that smoking has serious health ramifications. Some of the most common and serious health problems associated with smoking include cancer, heart and lung disease and stroke. According to studies, many of these medical problems can be attributed to the chemicals and toxins present in cigarettes. Also, smokers are more likely to experience premature death than nonsmokers and this further renders them more vulnerable in terms of medical treatment. 

Given these facts and the substantial burden smoking can have on public health, it is fair to expect a smoker to pay more for medical treatment than nonsmokers. This is because in public healthcare systems, nonsmokersâ€™ taxes are subsidising the healthcare costs of smokers who develop these diseases. This amounts to an intricate redistribution of the costs of smoking between smokers and the wider population. Thus, by charging a higher premium to those who opt to smoke, it is possible to reduce the costs of treating smokers and lessen the financial load on the public healthcare system. 

Additionally, this might result in smokers reevaluating their choices and potentially quit the habit thereby bringing down healthcare costs even more. Thus, this policy can help to bring about a healthier society. 

In conclusion, although it is understandable that the choice to smoke is very much personal, it is justifiable to argue that smokers should pay higher premiums for medical treatment than nonsmokers given the economic burden they place on the public healthcare system, while also influencing them to take more responsible decisions with regard to their health.
