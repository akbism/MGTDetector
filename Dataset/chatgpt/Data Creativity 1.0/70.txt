Nowadays, with the proliferation of television, cinema and Internet, media violence has become pervasive in our society. It is a constant debate whether the massive amount of violence portrayed in the media is responsible for enhancing violent behaviors in young people, and therefore, increasing societal violence. While some people are of the opinion that media violence negatively influences young people, I would argue that it is the upbringing and environment that has a greater impact on one’s behavior. Furthermore, I would support the notion that certain measures can be taken to reduce violence in our society today. 

It is true that media violence has an effect on young people, though researchers have been unable to link it to aggressive behavior. It is possible for children to be exposed to violent content in the media, yet remain unaffected and proceed in their normal lives. However, it would be unjust to divorce the influence of media violence from the effects of parental guidance and the environment that the children are nurtured in. Ascribed by experts, a child’s behavior is largely determined by the presence of positive interactions and supportive environment in which the child is brought up in. Therefore, reducing violence in our society today would require nurturing a positive environment for our young ones. 

It is concerning that media channels have become less mindful in curbing the amount of violence that they project. In this case, it would be serious misjudgment to blame these sources for the aggressive behavior in today’s society. This would be an oversimplification of the problem. Parents and guardians need to be more mindful and vigilant with the kind of content their children are exposed to, ensuring that appropriate age-appropriate programming is being viewed. Additionally, more broadcasting of public service announcements (PSAs) on curbing violence and promoting peaceful behaviors can greatly help in terms of sensitizing the public. Moreover, providing more resources and support to families can immensely help in keeping young people from indulging in violent activities. 

In conclusion, media violence undoubtedly has an effect on our young people. However, blaming media sources and oversimplifying the problem is unjust. Rather, greater efforts should be put in rooting out and reducing violence in our society today.Families should be equipped with the tools that enable them to offer their children the support, guidance and environment that prevent them from indulging in violent activities. Moreover, TV, internet and other media channels need to take more responsibility in providing appropriate age-related programs and broadcasting PSAs that encourage peaceful behaviors.
