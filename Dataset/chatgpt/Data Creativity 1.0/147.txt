In our modern world, technology is advancing faster than ever before, rapidly changing the way our society works. One of the biggest changes to result from this progress is the growing use of computers to replace human jobs. Automation has the potential to upend the traditional job market in favor of task-based computing, leaving some professionals without opportunities.

One example of a job that is on the cusp of being replaced by computers can be seen in the field of customer service. Companies often opt to use computer bots to field customer inquiries, providing quick and automated responses to customers instead of waiting for a human to assist them. This shift often causes customer service representatives to lose their jobs. Additionally, with the increasing adoption of self-serve checkout technology, cashiers are also likely to lose their jobs; machines are now being used to scan items, take payments, and even bag items without the need for a physical attendant.

The most concerning problem that could result from replacing human jobs with computers is a rise in the level of economic inequality. A large majority of the economy requires manual labor for operation, and as human workers lose their jobs to automation, society's wealth could become increasingly concentrated, leaving many people with fewer or no opportunities to secure a stable income. Unemployment would likely rise, as people were unable to find jobs to support themselves.

As the world becomes increasingly automated, some traditional jobs will inevitably vanish. Customer service representatives, cashiers, and an array of other jobs are now being replaced with computers, threatening the livelihoods of many people. This threatens to create a more unequal society and further widen the income gap between the richest and poorest in our society. Therefore, it is essential for both governments and corporations to work together to ensure that workers' rights are protected and all people are given equitable access to economic opportunities.
