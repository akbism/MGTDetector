Nowadays, the world is witnessing an unprecedented increase in population, which is bringing its own set of significant problems for both undeveloped and developed countries. Such mounting human populace is taking a toll on available natural resources, leading to numerous environmental and socio-economic issues. One of the major issues caused by overpopulation is the lack of space. Increasing people automatically lead to proliferation of cities and towns, thereby causing a lack of proper healthcare and educational services, as these are dependent on space. Consequently, people suffer from inadequate medical facilities, and it becomes difficult to provide quality education. In addition, overpopulation also leads to various socio-economic crises, such as hikes in the prices of commodities resulting from the shortage of available resources. 

Furthermore, extreme population in a particular area may lead to employment crisis, as there is an imbalance between the number of people and employment opportunities. For instance, there are a large number of people competing for fewer jobs in a particular region, featuring skyrocketing unemployment rate. This is a serious concern for poor, developed and developing countries, as people of such area may not find a job and subsequently, reside under the poverty line.

To reduce the problems caused by population growth, countries need to focus on encouraging family planning and conducting awareness campaigns regarding its advantages. Governments must ensure that couples have enough knowledge about the need for and the advantages of family planning. This will immensely help the couples to take an informed decision and plan their families accordingly, aiding in population control. Moreover, sex education in schools should be made mandatory, as it will enable children to understand the consequences of growing population. Additionally, flexible work policies should be implemented and companies should bear the responsibility of providing employees with various employment options.

In conclusion, it can be said that overpopulation can bring forth a series of problems and economic distress in countries. To tackle this problem, governments and private companies need to collaborate and implement policies that promote family planning and encourage the adoption of flexible working habits. With right implementation of laws, countries can efficiently bring down the problems associated with population growth.
