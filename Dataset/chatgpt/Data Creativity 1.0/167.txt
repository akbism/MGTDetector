Sports are a source of entertainment to people all around the world, but professional athletes make a much greater impact than that. They inspire young people to reach for their dreams, bring communities together and even glorify their countries on a global platform. Consequently, successful sports professionals are paid handsomely for the hard work, skill and fame that they bring with them.

On the one hand, there are people who believe that athletes should be paid more than people in other essential jobs. Champions can create ripples in their sport, thereby improving the sport and increasing the number of fans. Furthermore, the larger-than-life personalities that athletes have built generate a lot of revenue for their sport, which could be invested as revenue to help the sport grow further. This revenue also helps in providing a better standard of living to people in their hometowns and in improving their economies.

On the other hand, there are some who argue that such high payment limits opportunities available to people in other important professions. For instance, underprivileged children have an incredibly slim chance at getting a sports scholarship, as these are usually granted to those who are already highly talented and recognized athletes. Moreover, lesser-known sports in general tend to get lesser exposure and fewer opportunities than the big sports. Therefore, the same amount of money can be used to create better facilities and provide better wages to people who are in essential services like healthcare and education.

In my opinion, successful sports professionals should be handsomely rewarded, but equally generous compensation should be given to individuals in all the essential professions, for their dedication to the service and hard work. This is to ensure that such opportunities are available to all and no one is deprived from any social or economic benefits due to unequal payment or avenues. As professional sports gain more and more popularity every year, it is only fair to share the wealth with all those people who work hard to make sure these sports are celebrated.
