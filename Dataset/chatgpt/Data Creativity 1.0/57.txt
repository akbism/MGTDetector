The ability to speak multiple languages has become an essential part of the 21st century skill set, which is why it is vital for children to begin learning a foreign language as early as possible. I completely agree with this statement, due to several factors that will be explored in this essay.

One benefit of starting a foreign language early is that it takes much less effort and time to learn as a child instead of as an adult. Young minds have the natural capacity to absorb information quickly, allowing children to pick up new languages at a much faster rate â€” leading to quicker fluency and better pronunciation. Furthermore, when young children learn a language, they tend to learn it with less of an accent, which means they can better express themselves regardless of their native tongue.

Furthermore, learning a foreign language early on can give children the edge in their future academic and professional careers. For instance, being bilingual is advantageous for students when they complete their higher studies and need to apply for jobs. Employers often look for applicants who can converse in multiple languages and that can be beneficial for the individual, as it opens up more job options for them. Additionally, for those interested in international travel, being able to communicate in multiple languages can contribute to a richer travelling experience. 

In addition to these benefits for the individual, research suggests that children who begin their foreign language training at an early age are more likely to succeed in other areas, such as math and literacy development. This is because learning a language at an early age provides children with the opportunity to strengthen their critical thinking, problem-solving and communication skills; skills that are essential for success in all aspects of life. 

To conclude, I wholly agree with the statement that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Learning a second language has various advantages, such as the ability to communicate in multiple languages, an edge in one's academic and job careers, and improved cognitive abilities in other areas.
