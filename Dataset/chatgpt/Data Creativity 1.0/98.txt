Undoubtedly, English is a global language; it is spoken in many countries as either a first or a second language. Therefore, it is essential for many around the world to be competent in dealing with English. People who wish to be competent in the English language have many options when it comes to attending English language courses. One of the options entails studying English in an English-speaking country. While this is an effective way of learning English, it is not the only way. 

For starters, technology has come as a great advantage to students who can't afford to travel to an English-speaking country to learn English. The internet has made access to English language material incredibly easy, allowing students to stay in their current locations while learning the language. For instance, perhaps the most popular online English learning platform is the popular website, Duolingo. It is free, easy to use, and provides the user with interactive content to keep the user engaged. Furthermore, there are many other online English learning platforms students could use. Many countries also have their national languages and most have developed English courses that students can attend from their own homes. 

An additional way of learning English is by utilizing a language exchange. Language exchanges are when two or more people of different native language forms meet to learn each other's languages. This is a great way for participants to learn from each other without having to physically leave the comfort of their homes. In addition to this, there are many other methods of learning English without having to travel to an English-speaking country. 

In conclusion, studying English in an English-speaking country is an effective way of learning the language, however, it is not the only way. With the advent of modern technology, online courses and language exchanges, language learners can effectively study the language in their own locations. Therefore, I disagree with the statement as it overlooks the advantages modern technology has brought to language learning.
