When people need to complain about a product or poor service, it’s important to select the best method to ensure the complaint is heard and resolved. I personally believe that in most cases, the best method is to complain in person. 

Perhaps the most compelling reason to complain in person is that it allows for an in-depth discussion of the issue being addressed. For example, if I've purchased a faulty washing machine, voicing my complaint in person can be beneficial if I am able to demonstrate to the customer service representative the exact fault. Complaining in person also gives me the unique opportunity to gauge the emotional response of the customer service representative, which often helps me leverage better and faster resolution. Furthermore, by communicating in person I'm able to explain my side of the story more effectively. This ensures that all my grievances and reasons for being dissatisfied are communicated in a manner free of misinterpretation.

On the flip side, some people prefer to complain in writing. While this method can be effective as it allows documenting proof of the complaint that can be used later if needed, it often fails to provide in-depth communication as one would receive via face-to-face discussion. Furthermore, oftentimes the customer service representative responding to a written complaint may not be adequately trained to resolve the issue, leading to a longer resolution time. 

In conclusion, complaining in person provides the best opportunity for the issue to be heard and for a swift resolution to be achieved. In-person conversations also allows effective communication of both the customer’s dissatisfaction as well as why they are dissatisfied. This ultimately yields satisfactory results, as it combines the convenience of complaining in writing while providing the added benefit of in-person discussion.
