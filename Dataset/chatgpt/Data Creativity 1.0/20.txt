As someone who is appearing for the IELTS exam, I fully understand the importance of academic knowledge and its role in providing a strong foundation for children’s future. But, I also believe that it is important for them to learn about practical matters such as home management, work and interpersonal skills. In this essay, I will explain why I agree with this statement.

Being academically oriented is an important factor of education, but knowledge of practical matters provides children with the socio-economic skills they need to make well-informed decisions in later life. Home management skills can teach children how to comparatively shop for groceries and budget for daily expenses. This ensures better frugal living, helpful for managing finances well into adulthood. Knowing about work and interpersonal skills can prepare young people for their studies, career and job search. This knowledge assists youngsters in building a strong work ethic, which can help them secure meaningful employment.

Moreover, knowledge of practical skills prepares children for everyday life. It helps them to become independent and take decisions on his own. This is particularly beneficial in helping children to develop problem-solving skills. For example, being able to independently fetch groceries or other items, or repair things around the house, can instill the confidence in children that they can tackle life’s problems and become autonomous adults.

In conclusion, while academic knowledge is an integral part of the school curriculum, mastering practical skills such as home management, work and interpersonal skills holds more weight for a child’s future. By equipping them with complimentary knowledge and skills, children can be better prepared to make well-informed decisions and become responsible adults.
