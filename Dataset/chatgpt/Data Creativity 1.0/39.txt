In the contemporary world, television has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment, especially for children. Some people, however, believe that television programs are of no value for children. I, however, disagree with this statement and believe that television can be an effective tool for learning, imparting an understanding of the world and its people, and developing creativity in children. 

Firstly, television can be a powerful tool for educating children. Numerous television channels, such as the BBC’s Children’s BBC, Discovery Kids and Cartoon Network, specialize in providing educational content for young viewers. Apart from traditional learning materials, these channels present programs developed specifically for children; combining entertainment with education in an interesting way. For instance, National Geographic has produced a series of documentaries which provide useful information on the environment and its creatures; while the ‘Peppa Pig’ show combines the use of puppets and humour to teach young children about the importance of family values. 

In addition, television helps children understand and appreciate the diversity of people and cultures found in the world. Through programmes, particularly documentaries and travelogue series, young viewers can get an understanding of the culture and lifestyles of different groups. For instance, in India, the popular Channel V show called ‘The Circle of Life’ has exposed the younger generation to the cultural and social diversity found in different parts of the country. This phenomenon can also help reduce discrimination and create tolerance in the society, which is a highly valued trait. 

Moreover, television provides children with the opportunity to express their creativity in activities like drawing, colouring and arts and crafts. Through programmes like Art Attack and various cartoon series, children can be encouraged to create their own sketches and crafts, as well as learn from peers who take part in different competitions. This can also unlock children’s creative potential and help them to explore their artistic capabilities.

In conclusion, I believe that television can have significant educational and creative benefits for children. With the right selection of programmes and with proper guidance, it can fill the gap between learning in classrooms and life in the real world.
