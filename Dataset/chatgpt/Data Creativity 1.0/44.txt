Nowadays, advertising has become a primary means of influencing public opinion, particularly in cosmopolitan countries. The impact of advertisement is so visible on the landscape of many countries that it has become an essential tool for gaining an insight into the cultural, economic and social background of a nation. In this essay, I intend to explore the extent to which advertising can be seen as a reliable source to understand a particular country.

Firstly, it should be noted that advertisements can serve the purpose of presenting the current state of a nation's economy. For instance, during pandemics like these, a nation's economic activity greatly diminishes as a consequence of missed sales targets, market upheavals and other factors. Such state of economic distress can be inferred through advertisements of brands, wherein they are struggling to gain customer attention by offering various promo-codes and discounts. Overtime, one can track such trends and distinguish the growth-related symptoms of an economy.

Secondly, through the popularity of a product or brand in a country, one can easily understand the root cultural background of that society. For example, many Japanese Beer brands are available quite easily and largely preferred by their citizens. This showcases the age-old cultural and social fondness for alcohol. Similarly, in India, where cricket is by far the most popular sport, one can observe the presence of cricket players in several advertisements, demonstrating the love for this sport in the country.

Last but not least, from some advertisements, one can draw an outline of the most current happenings of a nation. For example, considering the recent Paris Climate Change Conference, a lot of advertisements that promote eco-friendly products, awareness and rules, highlighted the concerns of the nation pertaining to green technologies and climate change initiatives. This implies that advertisers are quite conscious of the international situation and act accordingly.

To conclude, it can be said that advertising plays a significant role in expressing the current state and cultural background of a country. This essay has provided several examples to depict why it can be taken as a reliable source to understand a particular country.
