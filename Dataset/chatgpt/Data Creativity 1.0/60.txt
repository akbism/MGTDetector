Many people across the world debate whether children should grow up in the countryside or in a big city. While both have interesting advantages, I would argue that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside. This is due to several different reasons, such as the healthier environment, encouraging self-development and growth and a greater sense of family bonding.

To begin with, the more natural and clean environment of a countryside acts as a strong catalyst for healthier physical growth for children. As the air quality and soil quality in a countryside is usually higher than in a city, children grow up with fewer health issues and illnesses. Furthermore, countrysides give the opportunity for children to explore nature by providing them with wide spreads of expansive land. This exploration helps children understand and connect with the environment at a deeper level. As a result, they get to observe seasonal transitions of nature, identify different species of animals, plants and trees. 

Growing up in the countryside also encourages self-development and growth of a child as it allows them to develop stronger interpersonal and problem-solving skills. Unlike the big city, the general pace of life in a countryside is much more relaxed, giving more time and opportunity for children to explore their creativity and curiosity. This curiosity factor can help in fostering the development of critical thinking and decision-making of a child. Additionally, a more interconnected community in a countryside also boosts the sociability of a child. As children interact with people of a wide range of ages and backgrounds in a more regular basis. 

Finally, living in the countryside promotes a closer family bonding among family members. While the occupants of cities often lack quality time with family members, a more relaxed and patient lifestyle of the countryside tends to encourage them to get to know each other better. This can be even more prominent in smaller communities where family members are extended to include neighbors, with everyone connecting for weekly community events, or through exchanging goods or services. In such an environment, kids usually get to spend more time with both their parents, thereby strengthening the bond between them.

In conclusion, based on the reasons discussed above, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside rather than a big city. From a healthier environment to closer family bonding, the benefits of living rural are plentiful.
