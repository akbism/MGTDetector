Science and technology have played a crucial role in modern living today. It has had a major effect on helped simplify the lives of people around the world in countless ways. From complex computing machines to wide-reaching communication systems, many of the tools we rely on are a product of advances in science and technology. However, it has been suggested that the increasing popularity of computers and calculators is having a dramatic negative impact on student literacy. This essay will discuss both the positive and negative effects of the progress of science and technology.

To begin with, there are numerous advantages. One of which is the growth of efficient communication, with the use of emails, text messages and the ever-expanding internet. This has enabled the sharing of ideas, research and knowledge faster and further than ever before. Additionally, computers, calculators and software have helped people to process information faster than ever. For example, mathematical calculations that used to take people hours can be solved by a programmed calculator in minutes, if not seconds.

However, it is certainly true that there are also a few disadvantages associated with this progress. One of the primary examples is a decrease in student literacy. Millions of students from all around the world often use computers and calculators to their answers in school work, instead of using traditional methods. This has led to reduced schoolwork quality, and a decrease in studentsâ€™ problem-solving skills. Moreover, some argue that students do not use computers and calculators as a tool to understand a problem, but as a way to avoid it.

In conclusion, the progress of science and technology has brought with it many positives, and also a few negative effects. The development of efficient communication and simplified calculations can help to improve many aspects of daily life, while over-dependency on machines can lead to a reduction in student literacy.
