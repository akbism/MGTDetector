The 21st century has brought a lot of fascinating changes to our lives. From advancements in technology to changes in lifestyle, a lot has evolved. One common phenomenon today is that the workplace has become more demanding, resulting in employees suffering from more stress and having less time to enjoy leisure activities. 

Undoubtedly, the pressure of work has increased over the years due to various reasons such as the changing economic climate, and the need to stay ahead of competition. In many places, employees are expected to work longer hours and increasing workloads, making it difficult for them to find time for relaxation. With the pressure at work increasing, it is natural for employees to feel stressed and overburdened, leading to an impact on their physical and mental health. 

However, this does not mean that all of us are doomed to an unhealthy lifestyle. We can take steps to manage our stress levels and keep a healthy balance between work and leisure. For instance, it is essential to recognize how much workload we can handle and plan our day accordingly. Also, taking regular breaks while at work, such as walking and allowing our minds to rest, can be of great benefit. Furthermore, engaging in activities we enjoy such as sports, playing an instrument, reading, or socializing with friends can help us relax and unwind. 

Ultimately, the onus lies on us to take charge of our own lives and prioritize our mental wellbeing. Pressure in the workplace may be tough to handle, but with effort and determination, we can make sure we do not succumb to stress and make the right amount of time for leisure activities.
