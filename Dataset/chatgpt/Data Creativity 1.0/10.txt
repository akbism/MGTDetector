It is said that universities should not focus on so much theoretical knowledge, but instead offer more practical training during their courses. This opinion is widely held by many people who perceive theoretical knowledge to be typically of little practical use. However, I cannot agree with this opinion and believe that universities should continue to provide a balanced approach, comprising both theoretical knowledge and practical training. 

Firstly, universities provide theoretical knowledge to develop the essential, fundamental beliefs and understandings of a fundamental concept or practice. This includes providing students with an understanding of the historical and cultural perspectives of the topic being studied. This knowledge equips students to identify possible problems or controversial issues associated with the topic and how to address those from a practical and theoretical angle. For instance, a student taking a degree in engineering will gain valuable theoretical knowledge on the principles of engineering that can later be translated into the practice of solving various engineering problems. 

Additionally, universities must provide practical training to help the students to gain essential hands-on experience with the concepts being studied. This training helps the students to gain the competence necessary to be able to apply the theoretical knowledge in practical settings such as the work environment. Practical training also builds confidence in students to solve problems and make better decisions. For example, computer engineers require practical applications of theoretical knowledge such as coding, debugging, and creating software interfaces in order to develop efficient and scalable systems.

In conclusion, it is not advisable to reduce the amount of theoretical knowledge provided by universities and focus solely on providing more practical training. The learning process should be balanced to ensure the students have an understanding of both the theoretical knowledge and how to practically apply that knowledge in order to solve problems in the future.
