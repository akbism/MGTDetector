Education is one of the most fundamental aspects of an individual’s life. It contributes to the growth of an individual and serves as a platform for the development of a successful career. Therefore, the availability of free and affordable education to everyone should be a priority for governments around the world. 

Proponents of free education argue that it will provide an opportunity for people belonging to all economic backgrounds to educate themselves equally. In addition, there is research backing the idea that universal access to education ensures economic growth of the country and reduction in poverty. For example, in Kenya, the provision of alternative education gave children the opportunity to get an education and contribute to their families’ well-being. Clearly, implementing such a policy can help countries become more competitive in the global market, as many would have an educated workforce.

On the other hand, the implementation of free education has several drawbacks. Primarily, free education is extremely expensive for governments in terms of financing. The financial burden will fall on the taxpayers who will not get any direct benefit. In addition, it’s difficult to manage the rising costs of education, as tuition and other fees are constantly on the rise. The provision of free education also reduces the quality of education, as governments struggle to find quality educators as they can’t offer competitive salaries. Last, it encourages individuals to rest on their laurels without taking much-needed initiatives to earn their degree.

In conclusion, while it’s important to provide free education to make it affordable for everyone, the governments should focus on the feasibility of such a policy. Making education more accessible should be based on initiatives taken to make students employable instead of just reducing the costs of tuition.
