The debate about the effects of smoking has been ongoing for decades, and the question of whether it should be banned is still highly controversial. Proponents of the ban argue that cigarettes are addictive, dangerous, and hazardous to public health and therefore society should take necessary steps to discourage people from smoking, while opponents of the ban argue that smoking should be a choice, particularly one made by adults.

On the one hand, smoked tobacco products are considered to be highly addictive and have been linked to certain chronic health issues such as lung cancer, bronchitis, and heart disease. It is estimated that more than 6 million people around the world die each year from smoking related diseases. Moreover, smoking also affects non-smokers who are forced to inhale second hand smoke. This is particularly detrimental for children and those with existing respiratory conditions. Effective public policies, including increased taxation for smokers, setting up smoke-free areas, and offering cessation programs, should be encouraged to reduce the number of people smoking and the risk of negative health outcomes.

On the other hand, it is argued that the choice to start or continue smoking should be made by individual adults in a free society. For instance, legal adult activities, such as the consumption of alcohol, are not subject to a ban, and we certainly should not deny peopleâ€™s right to make their own decisions, as long as they are not directly hurting or impacting other people. Smoking is an individual decision, and the government should not be the one to decide whether it is right or wrong based on their own opinion. Additionally, it is said that banning smoking would deprive governments of a significant amount of tax and revenue.

In conclusion, while I believe that the government should take steps to reduce the amount of smoking and limit the effects of second hand smoke, I believe that decisions about smoking should be left to individuals. The government should provide education, resources, and effective public policies to help reduce the number of people who choose to smoke and to protect non-smokers from second hand smoke. At the same time, it should give individuals the ability to make their own choices, free from the interference of government.
