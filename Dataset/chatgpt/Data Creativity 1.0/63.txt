The increasing popularity of IELTS around the world has raised various questions and debates, including whether children of different levels of intelligence should be taught together or separately. Supporters of teaching them together believe it will develop the abilities of all children and eliminate the gaps between them. On the other hand, proponents of teaching those with higher intelligence separately from those with lower intelligence believe it is more efficient and beneficial for their education. As someone taking the IELTS exam, it is clear to me that both arguments are valid, and that the decision to teach together or separately should be made on a case-by-case basis.

One key point in favour of teaching children with different levels of intelligence together is the tremendous potential of a diverse classroom. By combining those with higher intelligence with those of a lower level, the teachers can develop teaching strategies catered to individual strengths and weaknesses, while providing enough challenge to those of higher intelligence. Furthermore, these students can mentor the others, essentially giving rise to a cooperation-oriented environment. This encourages a caring community and allows for both lower-level and higher-level students to learn from each other, develop social skills, and form beneficial differences in how they approach their learning.

On the other hand, teaching students with higher intelligence separately is also beneficial for their education. Devoting all the available teaching resources specifically to those with higher levels of intelligence can give them the opportunity to thrive and achieve greater academic success. Furthermore, teaching those of higher intelligence separately can help them learn in depth without feeling ashamed of their superiority; not to mention, its effectiveness for students who are bored or need to cover material that their peers are not ready for.

In conclusion, I believe it is difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to teaching children of different levels of intelligence. Circumstances and student demographics should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to teach them together or separately. That being said, I believe the benefits of teaching them together are more significant when it comes to developing a strong educational environment.
