People should not be limited to reading books that only focus on real events, real people and established facts. I believe that it’s also important to read books that contain speculative elements, as these books can help us to consider, reflect and develop our personal opinions. 

Firstly, reading fiction can help to broaden mental horizons and challenge beliefs. Through reading stories about characters, events and situations that may be largely fictional, we can start to reflect upon our own values and beliefs. As the German author Goethe once said “It is not a question of gathering new facts but of forming a judgement on what we know.” By experiencing books with imaginary stories and situations, readers can consider how they measure up to the characters and form personal opinions and perspectives. 

Furthermore, reading fiction can help to promote empathy and understanding of different cultures and beliefs. By reading books containing such imaginative elements, we can be transported through time and place to gain an understanding of different people and what they believe and value. Such literature has the potential to widen tolerance and provide insight into different parts of the world, where linguistic, cultural and contextual barriers might otherwise exist. 

Having said this, it is also important to read books that contain real events and established facts in order to build knowledge and understanding. A balanced approach to reading is of great value in forming holistic opinions, providing factual information, and developing one’s knowledge. 

In summary, I believe that reading books with speculative elements as well as books about real events and established facts is important for personal intellectual growth. While fictional literature serves to challenge mental horizons and broaden understanding of different cultures and beliefs, books about real events and topics enhance existing knowledge.
