Immunisation against childhood diseases is an important part of healthcare for many children. Parents should be obligated to immunise their children against diseases if they can afford to do so. Vaccines help protect children from developing illnesses from viruses, bacteria and parasites that can cause serious complications or death. Immunisation also helps protect the whole population from epidemic or pandemic outbreak of infectious diseases.

On the other hand, some people believe individuals should have the right to choose not to vaccinate their children if they wish. Proponents of this opinion argue that every person has the right to determine what is best for their own children and their family as a whole. Additionally, they argue that the risks of side effects from immunisation outweigh the benefits.

In my opinion, parents should be obligated to immunise their children if they have the means to do so. Vaccines are among the most cost-effective ways of protecting children from infectious diseases, while maintaining the population’s overall immunity. Furthermore, many countries provide free or subsidised vaccines, making them more affordable and accessible. However, this should not be compulsory as there are certain medical cases where immunisation is contraindicated, such as in young children with certain medical conditions.

It is also important to take into consideration the wider implications of not immunising. If a large portion of the population is not immunised, this can result in an increased risk of the spread of infectious diseases in the general community. This could be especially dangerous for those who cannot be immunised due to having specific allergies or other medical conditions such as cancer, who rely on ‘herd immunity’ for protection.

In conclusion, I believe that parents should be obliged to immunise their children against childhood diseases if they can afford to do so. Vaccines are a safe and cost-effective way to protect children from potentially fatal infectious diseases, while also helping to protect the wider community. However, the decision should remain ultimately in the hands of parents, and medical cases where immunisation is contraindicated should be given due consideration.
