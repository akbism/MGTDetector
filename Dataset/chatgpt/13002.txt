The phrase “Not everything that is learned is contained in books” is a reminder that knowledge can be gained from sources other than books. Although books are a great source of knowledge, experience is just as important in learning. Books provide us with facts, figures, and theories that can help us understand the world. On the other hand, experience gives us the chance to apply what we have learned from books and to gain a deeper understanding of the world. Both sources of knowledge are important in their own ways and can provide us with valuable insights.

When it comes to deciding which source of knowledge is more important, it depends on the context. For example, if someone is studying for an exam, knowledge gained from books is likely to be more important as it will provide them with the facts and figures they need to pass the exam. However, if someone is trying to gain a better understanding of the world, knowledge gained from experience is likely to be more important. This is because experience allows us to apply our knowledge in real-world situations and gain a deeper understanding of the world.

In my opinion, both sources of knowledge are equally important. Books provide us with the facts and figures we need to understand the world, while experience allows us to apply what we have learned and gain a deeper understanding of the world. Without books, we would not have access to the knowledge we need to understand the world, and without experience, we would not be able to apply our knowledge in real-world situations. Therefore, both sources of knowledge are essential in learning.
