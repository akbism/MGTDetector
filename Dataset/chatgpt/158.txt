Leisure time is a precious commodity in our increasingly busy lives. While some people believe that leisure time should be used to engage in activities that stimulate the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles, others believe that it is important to rest the mind during this time. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and explain why I believe it is important to strike a balance between the two. 

On the one hand, it is important to use leisure time to engage in activities that improve the mind. Reading is an excellent example of this. Reading books, magazines, and newspapers can help to expand our knowledge and understanding of the world. Furthermore, engaging in word puzzles such as crosswords and Sudoku can help to improve our problem-solving skills and logical thinking. These activities can help us to stay mentally sharp and alert, and can even help to reduce the risk of developing dementia in later life. 

On the other hand, it is also important to rest the mind during leisure time. This can involve activities such as listening to music, watching television, or taking a nap. These activities can help us to relax and unwind after a long day, and can help us to recharge our batteries and prepare for the next day. Furthermore, taking time out to relax can help to reduce stress and anxiety, and can even help to improve our physical health. 

In conclusion, I believe it is important to strike a balance between engaging in activities that stimulate the mind, and taking time out to rest the mind. Both activities are important for our overall wellbeing, and both should be included in our leisure time.
