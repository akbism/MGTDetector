I disagree with the statement that people should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. I believe that people should read a variety of books, including those that are about fiction, in order to gain a more complete understanding of the world.

First of all, reading fiction allows people to explore ideas, emotions, and situations that may not be present in real life. Through reading fiction, people can gain a greater insight into the human condition, and explore different perspectives and possibilities. For example, reading dystopian novels can help people to understand the consequences of certain political and social decisions, and to consider alternate paths that could be taken. Fiction also allows people to escape from the real world, and to explore different settings and characters.

In addition, reading fiction can help people to develop empathy and understanding. By reading about characters that are different from themselves, people can gain a better understanding of the struggles and experiences of others. This can help people to become more compassionate and understanding of those around them.

Finally, reading fiction can help people to become better writers. By reading different types of stories, people can learn how to better structure their own stories and develop their own writing style.

In conclusion, I believe that people should read a variety of books, including those that are about fiction, in order to gain a more complete understanding of the world. Fiction can help people to explore ideas, emotions, and situations that may not be present in real life, as well as to develop empathy and understanding. It can also help people to become better writers.
