The past century has seen a number of remarkable inventions and discoveries that have had a lasting impact on the world and the way we live our lives. In my country, the most beneficial discovery of the last 100 years, in my opinion, has been the internet.

The internet has revolutionized communication, providing us with faster and more efficient ways to connect with people from all over the world. We can now send emails and instant messages, video chat with friends and family, and even collaborate on projects with colleagues from different countries. The internet has also opened up vast amounts of information, giving us access to a wealth of knowledge and resources that would otherwise be inaccessible.

The internet has also had a profound effect on the economy. Businesses can now advertise and reach a much larger customer base, allowing them to expand and grow. The internet has also enabled the development of e-commerce, which has made it easier for people to buy and sell goods and services from the comfort of their own homes.

The internet has also had a positive impact on education. Schools can now provide students with access to online resources, such as educational videos, articles, and interactive activities. This makes learning more engaging and accessible, allowing students to learn at their own pace and in their own way.

Finally, the internet has provided a platform for people to express their opinions and share their ideas. People can now connect with like-minded individuals and discuss topics that they are passionate about. This has allowed people to become more informed and empowered, giving them the opportunity to make a difference in their communities.

In conclusion, the internet has been the most beneficial discovery of the last 100 years for people in my country. It has revolutionized communication, enabled businesses to expand, made education more accessible, and provided a platform for people to express their voices.
