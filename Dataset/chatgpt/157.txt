In the world today, there is a great disparity between the rich and the poor countries. Rich countries are those with high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, while the poorer countries are those with low GDP per capita. This divide between the rich and the poor has been a major source of debate and contention, especially in the context of whether the rich countries should help the poorer ones. It is argued that helping the poorer countries will only make them dependent on the rich countries and will not benefit them in the long run. On the other hand, some argue that the rich countries have a moral obligation to help the poorer countries, and that it will benefit both the countries in the long run. 

The proponents of the idea that rich countries should help the poorer ones suggest that the rich countries have the resources and the means to do so. They argue that the rich countries should use their resources to help the poorer countries out of poverty, and that this will help the world become a better place. They also point out that the rich countries have a moral obligation to help the poorer countries, and that they should use their resources to do so. 

On the other hand, the opponents of the idea that rich countries should help the poorer ones suggest that this will only make the poorer countries dependent on the rich countries. They argue that the poorer countries should be able to stand on their own feet and should not be reliant on the help of the richer countries. They also argue that the money and resources given to the poorer countries will only end up in the hands of corrupt leaders, and that the money will not be used to benefit the people of the poorer countries. 

In my opinion, I believe that rich countries should help the poorer ones, but in a way that does not make the poorer countries dependent on the richer countries. The money and resources given to the poorer countries should be used to help them become self-sufficient and independent. This could be done by providing educational and healthcare facilities, as well as providing financial aid to help them build their own economy. This will help the poorer countries become self-sufficient and independent, and will benefit both the countries in the long run. 

In conclusion, I believe that the rich countries should help the poorer ones, but in a way that does not make them dependent on the richer countries. This will benefit both the countries in the long run, and will help create a better world.
