Moving to a new country is a life-altering experience and can be both exciting and daunting. It is natural for people to feel a sense of belonging and to want to fit in with the new culture. However, it is also important to maintain one’s own identity and customs. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of both following the customs of the new country and keeping one’s own customs.

On one hand, it is important to respect and follow the customs of the new country. This will help one to integrate into society, make friends, and find employment. It also allows one to experience the new culture and to learn about different customs and traditions. Moreover, it is a sign of respect to the new country and its people.

On the other hand, one should also keep their own customs and traditions alive. This allows one to maintain a sense of identity and belonging to their own culture. It also helps in preserving their culture and passing down the customs and traditions to future generations. Furthermore, it is a way to celebrate one’s own culture and to share it with others.

In my opinion, it is important to find a balance between the two. It is important to respect and follow the customs of the new country, while at the same time, keeping one’s own customs and traditions alive. This way, one can experience the best of both worlds. One can learn about and appreciate the new culture, while also celebrating their own culture and identity. This will help one to feel more connected to both the new country and their home country.
