The idea of fatherhood being equally emphasised as motherhood is a concept that has been gaining traction in recent times, with many people agreeing that this is indeed the case. However, there are still some who disagree with this idea, believing that it is the mother who is solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies, and therefore also responsible for bringing the children up. 

I firmly believe that both parents should be equally involved in the decision-making process when it comes to having children, and that both should be equally responsible for raising them. As a society, we should be encouraging fathers to take a more active role in their children’s lives, both in the home and outside of it. Fathers can provide a unique perspective on life and help shape their children’s values and beliefs. They can also provide emotional support and guidance, which is equally as important as the physical and financial support that mothers can provide. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that children who grow up in a household with both parents actively involved in their lives tend to have better outcomes in terms of emotional and social development. Studies have shown that children who have a strong relationship with both parents have higher self-esteem, better communication skills, and better problem-solving abilities. This is why it is so important for fathers to be actively involved in their children’s lives. 

In conclusion, I believe that fatherhood should be equally emphasised as motherhood, and that both parents should be equally involved in the decision-making process when it comes to having children, as well as in the raising of them. This is important for the emotional and social development of children, and can have a positive impact on their lives.
