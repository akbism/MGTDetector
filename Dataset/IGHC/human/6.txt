Over the past few decades, academic subjects have become increasingly important in
this fast-changing information-based society. Nowadays, there has been a growing
debate as to whether it would be more effective to replace physical education classes with
academic subjects. Despite the importance of sports, I highly believe that it is inevitable
and more efficient to focus more on academic subjects for several reasons.
Those who argue that sports and exercise classes are needed in school base their case
on the following arguments. First of all, sports are a good way to build character and
develop personality. That is, there are necessary for learning about competition,
cooperation, and good sportsmanship. In addition, as a majority of children these days
are addicted to the Internet, they find it hard to leave their computer. Consequently, a
growing number of children are becoming overweight or obese due to a lack of exercise.
So, if schools foster an environment that deprives students of getting a proper physical
education, it will have a long-term negative effect on children both mentally and
physically.
Nevertheless, people should not ignore the fact that devoting more time and energy to
academic subjects will benefit students more in the long run. The time devoted to physical
education now would be better spent teaching students English. This is because speaking
fluent English will give young people an advantage over other college applicants and job
seekers in the near future. Besides, science will undoubtedly benefit youth more than
physical education as well. The principles learned in science will provide the necessary
foundation for solving and difficult problems that are sure to arise in students' futures.
In summary, there are high hopes that educators and parents exercise wisdom in
teaching young generations.
