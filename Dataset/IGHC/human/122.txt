The growth of tourism and the numbers of people travelling to other countries for their
vacations has led to debate as to whether this is beneficial. I believe that there are many
problems which arise out of the tourist industry, and will examine these in detail.
Many people argue that travel broadens the mind. However, this statement does not fully
hold water. I would argue that spending a few weeks in another country is not long
enough to gain a proper understanding of an alien culture. A foreigner visiting Britain
might be met with the traditional British reserve, and mistakenly conclude that the British
are unfriendly. Furthermore, some people are unwilling to open their minds. A Western
traveller to an Arab country is unlikely to consider that the veiling of women is acceptable.
Being a tourist in a foreign country brings with it problems that can lead to dislike of the
native people. Firstly, a foreigner is vulnerable, and is often ripped off by locals. Secondly,
the language barrier can lead to misunderstandings. Thirdly, tourists are often hassled to
buy goods, which can ruin a holiday. When I went to Bali, people tried to sell me
something every five minutes, and this totally spoilt my sunbathing.
Local people also often end up disliking foreigners. Visitors may mistakenly act contrary to
local norms, or they may just be plain offensive, as many drunken British holidaymakers
must seem to the Spanish. Global tourism can lead to hostility from the native people,
who may feel their traditional way of life is under threat. Additionally, the relative wealth of
the foreign visitors can cause envy and resentment.
In conclusion, I would say that I largely agree with the argument that global tourism
creates misunderstanding between people from different cultures, and that the differences
are often a cause for conflict rather than celebration.
