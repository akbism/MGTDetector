The idea that a marriage should be arranged by the parents of the couple, or by other
members-of the family, is quite acceptable to some societies, yet completely out of the
question for others. It all depends on your cultural expectations.
In so-called western societies, it is very unusual for marriages to be arranged. Most young
people would not welcome the idea that their parents have the right to choose their
partner for life. They feel that arranged marriages deny them their fundamental right to
choose, even if they make a bad decision.
However, if we are honest about it, we might acknowledge that some parents organise
their children's lives in such a way that they are likely to meet and marry partners the
parents approve oÂ£ It could be said that this is, to some extent, similar to an arranged
marriage. It is always better when families support the relationship and welcome the
grandchildren.
People for whom arranged marriages are the cultural norm often argue that the likelihood
of the marriage lasting is greater when it is set up in this manner. Parents can be assured
that their children are joining a family of similar standing and cultural background, and
this, in the long run, makes for a more stable society if your parents' marriage was
arranged, and has worked well, then why should you question the custom?
The important thing to ensure is that people are never forced into a marriage which will
make them unhappy or lead to an unequal relationship where one partner is exploited by
the other. This applies in all societies and situations.
