Nowadays, as roads are becoming more and more crowded, people are considering both
the advantages and disadvantages of having a car before they buy one.
The main advantage of the car is that it gives the freedom to travel when and where you
want, without being limited to fixed routes and timetables. What is more, you can carry
several passengers and as much luggage as you like, at no extra cost. In addition to this,
you can travel in comfort in a car, with a seat to yourself and the possibility of comforts
such as a music system and air conditioning.
On the other hand, owning a car is very expensive. As well as the price of the car, the
cost of tax, insurance, petrol and repairs must also be considered before buying.
Moreover, the increase in traffic means that drivers are spending more and more time
stuck in traffic jams. Perhaps the major disadvantage of cars in general is the huge
damage that they do to human life and to the environment, and all motorists much accept
that they are making a small contribution to this.
To sum up, provided you have access to an efficient public transport system, then buying
and running your own car could be considered an expensive luxury.
