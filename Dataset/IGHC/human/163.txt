From my everyday experience and observation I can claim that discussion of an important
decision with other people bring many benefits. In the following paragraphs I will give my
reasons to defend this statement.
First of all, different people have different opinions. In order to make the right choice
people should discuss every possible decision and its consequences. Making an
important decision alone can bring many negative aspects. For instance, a person can
reveal his selfishness or impatience and the consequences of that decision can affect
many people in the future. I think that a good and wise decision can be born only in
discussion because people can share their knowledge and experiences a look at the
problem from different sides and aspects.
Second of all, I think that making decision alone is unacceptable especially for a
company. Imagine that a chief makes the decision about increasing a production line
without discussing it with his employees. In this case a part of company's profit will be
spending on extended purchase of raw materials. So, share holders will be left without
dividends. This decision may lead to getting rid of company's shares and as a result of
this declining the value of a company as a whole.
To sum up, I think that a person should always consult his relatives or colleges when
making an important decision to avoid possible mistakes.
