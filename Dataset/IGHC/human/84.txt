There is much discussion nowadays as to whether or not the relation-ship between family
members is as close as before. Diverse contributing factors can be identified. In the
following, I would like to present my point of view.
Great changes have taken place in family life along with the development of society. One
of them is that the once-extended family tends to become smaller and smaller. Many
children have to leave their parents at an early age to study or work elsewhere. As time
passes, children become emotionally estranged from their parents.
Compared with the past, social competition is becoming increasingly fierce. People are
urged to concentrate their efforts upon work, so that they can achieve success, or at least
a good standard of living. As a result, they canâ€™t afford to spend their leisure hours with
their families. The importance of bonds of kinship is gradually fading from their minds.
In addition, the availability of various kinds of recreational facilities also diverts people
from enjoying chats with the members of their families. Their free time is mostly occupied
by watching TV, surfing the Internet or playing video games. They come to lose interest in
communicating with the other members of their families.
In view of such alienation within families, urgent steps must be taken, in my opinion. For
members of families who live away from one another, regular contact on the phone can
bring them the care that they need. Family reunions on holidays or other important
occasions can make a difference as well. For those living together, it is a good idea to
take some time off work or recreation periods to spend more time with each other. In the
final analysis, a close family relationship can surely be maintained as long as we realize
the significant role it plays in our lives and attach importance to it.
