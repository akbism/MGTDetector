Man, through the ages, has undergone many changes from the time when he depicted a
herd of mammoths on the walls of the cave to these days when he can chart with
someone on the other side of the globe. Modern technology is rapidly changing the
world's living standards that results in creating a single world culture. New technologies
including Internet, television, electronic media, means of transportation, etc has a great
impact on creating a similar culture all around the globe. Bellow I will list my reasons to
support my opinion.
First of all, Internet and e-mail have changed the way people communicate to each other.
Internet brought many benefits. It is a new means of communication, a fast access to
information and news. People communicate with each other, share their ideas, happiness
and difficulties. We have a great opportunity to find out more about countries and their
history.
Second of all, the modern means of transportation allows people to move from one place
to another very quickly. A few centuries ago it was impossible to imagine waking up in
one country and falling asleep in another.
Finally, as a result of all mentioned above the boundaries between countries, their
traditions and customs are erased. Many people migrate during their lives. Some of them
are looking for a better place to live, others want to get new experience and knowledge or
just pleasure. So, many families are created between people from different countries.
Traditions fuse and evolve into other ones or just vanish.
To sup up, modern technology has a great impact on the way people live now. It is
creating a new single world culture where traditions and distances are no longer of that
importance.
