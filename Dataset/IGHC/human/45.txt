I think that everyone can divide all advertising products and services into useless ones
and useful ones. It is like looking through an information desk when you pay attention to
those messages that interest you. Take me for example.
I do not like jewelry. It does not mean I do not have it at all, I have a couple of inexpensive
rings as gifts from my parents. I just think, people pay too much attention to this stuff. I
believe it is the result of mass advertising. Every day when I am watching TV, listening to
the radio or reading the paper I notice many ads about getting an expensive ring, chain,
necklace or ear-rings. From my point of view these kinds of advertising contaminate
people's minds. In this case you are encouraged to buy things you do not really need.
They make you believe you need such products in order to succeed or be happy.
From the other side, I think that advertisements of the new detergents with up-to-date
formulas to help you maintain your cloth in perfect conditions, the new cars with some
extra futures that make your traveling more comfortable and sports goods that make your
life healthier may help you to improve your life.
Recently my husband and I saw an ad on the Internet about a very interesting and
inexpensive vocation to Japan for a week. Is not it awesome? We like traveling. So now
we are planning to find out more about it and, may be, make reservations. I believe that
without advertisements we would be unaware about plenty of oppotunities that may make
your life happier, easier and less stressful.
My point is that every person has his own scale of values. So if he is vegetarian he will
consider an ad about meat products useless for him.
