Over the past few decades, the world has significantly changed. Nowadays, many have
begun to wonder what the reasons behind  these changes are. Two major factors
contributing to this phenomenon are advances in media and change family dynamics
[=organization].
First, advances in media, such as the Internet and TV, have meant that children spend a
large portion of their leisure time in front of a screen. Consequently, they are not getting
proper amounts of exercise, which results in an increase in the number of children who
are overweight and obese. In addition, fast food restaurants have become increasingly
popular, which has also contributed to children's health problems
Moreover, another leading force of this trend is changes in the family unit. Compared with
a half century ago, nuclear families have become way more common in modern society.
People tend to have only one child, which has caused personality disorders such as
depression, loneliness, and selfishness. This is mainly because parents with one child
have tendency to put all their focus and money into their only son or daughter. Studies
have indicated that over 65% of children who are brought up without siblings show selfcentered behavior find it difficult cooperating with their peers.
In summary, there are many factors that have caused children to live very differently from
the generation before them. There are high hopes that parents exercise(s) wisdom in
treating their children.
