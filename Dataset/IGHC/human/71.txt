Movies tend to have a very large influence on young people who are influenced both by
what they see and hear. Because this is the case, it is true that car chases in action
movies tend to lead to an increase in the number of car accidents among young drivers
because they try to copy what they have seen in the films. They drive too fast and take
unnecessary risks and the difficulty is that most young people lack the skills and
experience to do this.
There are a variety of ways in which young people can be encouraged to practise safer
driving habits. Firstly, the Government should launch a safe driving campaign to convey
the fact that driving safely is not uncool. In effect, it should be cool to stay alive and
healthy! Secondly, every movie should make it clear that dangerous car chases are
undertaken only in strict safety conditions with experienced drivers, and often special
movie-making tricks are used to enhance the action. Thirdly, young people should be
forced to take safe driving courses every year for the first five years that they have their
driver's licence. In this way, they are forced to perfect their driving skills or their licence
will be taken away.
Finally, as part of this course, young drivers should go to hospitals and witness the effects
of poor or dangerous driving on other people. When they see hospitalised people whose
lives have been destroyed due to stupid risk-taking, they will surely change their minds
about whether it is cool to copy action heroes and drive fast.
