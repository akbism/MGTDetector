The view that women are better parents than men has shown itself to be true throughout
history. This is not to say that men are not of importance in child- rearing indeed, they are
most necessary if children are to appreciate fully the roles of both sexes. But women have
proven themselves superior parents as a result of their conditioning, their less aggressive
natures and their generally better communication skills.
From the time they are little girls, females learn about nurturing. First with dolls and later
perhaps with younger brothers and sisters, girls are given the role of carer. Girls see their
mothers in the same roles and so it is natural that they identify this as a female activity.
Boys, in contrast, learn competitive roles far removed from what it means to nurture.
While boys may dream of adventures, girls' conditioning means they tend to see the
future in terms of raising families.
Girls also appear to be less aggressive than boys. In adulthood, it is men, not women,
who prove to be the aggressors in crime and in war. Obviously, in raising children, a more
patient, gentle manner is preferable to a more aggressive one. Although there certainly
exist gentle men and aggressive women, by and large, females are less likely to resort to
violence in attempting to solve problems.
Finally, women tend to be better communicators than men. This is shown is intelligence
tests, where females, on average, do better in verbal communication than males. Of
course, communication is of utmost importance in rearing children, as children tend to
learn from and adopt the communication styles of their parents.
Thus, while it is all very well to suggest a greater role for men in raising children, let us not
forget that women are generally better suited to the parenting role.
