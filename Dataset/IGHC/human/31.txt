In today's world, due to the advancement of technology new inventions are coming into
existence. It is a certainty that ?necessity is a mother of invention? Internet is just like a
wonder box, which contains every type of information. Besides it has also proved as a
very important tool to connect people with each other.
In today's modernized era nobody has sufficient time to write letters to their loved ones.
Moreover it also takes longer to send or receive any information. But through an internet it
is an easiest way to send massages to our loved ones. Either it can be in the form of an
e- mail or by text messages from internet to cell phones. We can send and receive
messages straight way.
In other hand today's youth generation mostly prefer to do chatting on internet.
Through this chatting we can write messages and straight way can get their reply.
Moreover voice chatting is going to be very popular day-by-day.
As it is a reality that advantages and disadvantages are like both sides of a coin, which
usually runs parallel. So like other things internet also have some downsides, like people
are facing some health problems for example, poor eye-sight, back ache, migrane.
Today's teenagers usually prefer to spend their time on internet rather than to
participating in other physical activities, so that's why they are going to be weaker in their
physical health.
To conclude, I would like to say that internet is one of the most modernized and most
successful tools, not only for communication, even to get most relevant information
regarding every field in a very short period of time.
