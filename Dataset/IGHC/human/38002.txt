News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers.
There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they
tend on. Because each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if
your customers are almost teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting
them such as stories, photographs about singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and young
fashion. It will be very silly if you try to provide teenagers with economic, politic news. On
the contrary, besiness men and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or
Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influence news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of
their customers.
The second is the hot, the attraction of news. Who will reads or watchs your news if it was
one year, one month ago even last week? The answer is nobody absolutely. In the
energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for really new news. So
that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has
already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they will lose their
customers. None of editors wants that bad future.
On television or in newspaper, we seem to become used to bad news. It is a little of
difficult for us to meet a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things occur on the
earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more customer, which
means more and more money, by bad news. Because bad news makes us curious. We
want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we
will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of
course, news editors.
I think it would be better if more good news was reported. Bad news makes us worry and
sad. Whereas good news makes us happy. How much bad news is, there should be the
same amount of good news. So, we can give something bad a lot of thought while still be
joyful with good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be
avoided. That is the best solution.
Now, we can’t live without news. Thereby, the role of news editors is very important. We
should support them. And what they have to do is try their best to provide us useful news,
both good and bad.
Some of your sentences are too short - they would look better joined together.
Overall, a very good essay ? to me it looks like Band 7 candidate.
