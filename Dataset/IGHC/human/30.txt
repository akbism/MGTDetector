Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible
reasons why it can happen.
First, some data may be unverifiable. For example, everytime they search for a data,
there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if
the data they are reading has accurate information. Some sources have even outdated
informations. Second, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one
site that sells goods using online purchases. The goods would be paid for by credit card
but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available
through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century
paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that it would only be
available in the library.
Others believe that internet is very useful and these are the justifications. First, it is hard to
get data, that is available in the net by other means. For example, if directory information
could not give me the accurate address and contact number of the place I want to visit, I
normally check that information from the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the
details of that certain company. Second, research becomes more comprehensive. For
instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of
the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily
compared and contrasted. I remember, my cousin researched the study about overweight
children a decade ago and at present. He was able to finish his research in just one day,
as compared to week if he would not use the Internet.
In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it
makes data retrieval and comparison easier.
