People are learning and practicing through their entire life. I believe that life experience
and practice are the basic reasons of the humankind's evolution. However, in my opinion,
knowledge gained from books plays a very important role in the modern life.
The most obviously important advantage of books is that they hold all knowledge gained
by previous generations. People write books about their discoveries and inventions, which
are gained through practice and experience. This knowledge is accumulated in books that
are passed from generation to generation. So, basically, people get all knowledge about
the previous achievements from books, analyze it and than, according to their experience
and new data, write new books. In this case, books are the holders of humankind's
experience.
For example, at old times people thought that the Earth was flat. It was concluded from
observations and studdying. However, the next generations, using the experience of their
ancestors, proved that the Earth was round.
Personally, I think that books are very important because they are able to give people the
basic and fundamental knowledge. Books store history, the important events and
discoveries. Without them it is difficult and sometimes impossible to move forward, make
new discoveries and inventions.
To summarize, I think a person should take basic knowledge from books because it will
help him to make his own inventions, conclusions and discoveries. Only using both books
and oneâ€™s experience one can move forward.
