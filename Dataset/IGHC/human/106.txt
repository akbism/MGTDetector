Some people think that old, historic buildings are no need for the city and they should be destroyed and replaced with modern ones. However, other people believe that historic buildings must be preserved in order to know and remember our past. For several
reasons that I will mention bellow I agree with those people who want to preserve old,
historical buildings.
First of all, by preserving historical buildings we pass our history to our future generations.
I think that out children should know their history, learn from it and respect it. People need
to know their traditions and customs, which are priceless and irreplaceable. Our history is
our knowledge and power. From my opinion we need to preserve and restore historical
buildings. By destroying them we show our disrespect to our forefathers and their
traditions.
Second of all, by preserving historical buildings a city can attract many travelers.
Welcoming tourists a city can get many benefits including money, which can be spent on
preserving historical buildings as well as on improving roads and facilities.
Also, many tourists mean a lot of new business opportunities. Another important aspect of
this is that businessmen will be willing to build new recreational centers, hotels, movie
theaters, shopping centers to make a city more attractive for travelers. In addition to those
practical benefits, many people will have the opportunity to get a job. All this is good for
the economy of the city.
To sum up, I believe that preserving old, historical buildings can bring only benefits to a
city and all humankind.
