Some people say that the invention of computers is one of the greatest humankind's
inventions. However, other people think that computers make their life more stressful. I
agree with those people who think that computers brought many benefits and play a very
important role in our modern life.
First of all, every company nowadays uses a computer to store its data and make different
kinds of operations. It is very difficult to imagine life without computers. A company would
have to store millions of papers and documents. Moreover, a customer would have to wait
hours to check his balance or get a piece of information about his transactions at his
bank, while an employee was looking trough those papers. Another important aspect of
this is that people are able to type all their information, make corrections, print or send
documents using computers. It makes life much easier. One can spend the rest of the
time watching TV with his family or working on something new.
We use computers every day sometimes even not knowing it. When we go to a store and
use our credit cards many computers process our information and perform transactions.
When we need to get some cash we use money access machines that are computerized
too.
Second of all, computers provided a great means of communication - the Internet. I think
it is the easiest and cheapest way to get in touch with relatives, friends, business
colleagues, etc. Nowadays the world becomes smaller and smaller. When I was a little
girl, I could not imagine that it would be possible to communicate with people from all
around the world in so easy way. A person can get latest news, become friends with
someone from another country, find his old friends, ask for a piece of advice, etc.
Finally, in addition to these practical benefits people can shop without leaving their house.
They just use an Internet access, a computer and their cards to make a payment. It is
kind of difficult to imagine that a few years ago people had to spend their time in lines
buying tickets. Now, a person can choose a destination, company, date and time and get
tickets delivered to his door. I think it is amazing.
To sum up, I believe that computers made our lives easier. They change our attitude
towards life. I think with the invention of computers people became closer and friendlier.
