When computers first made their way into the business sector, everyone believed that
they would make people's jobs easier. What was not expected was that computers would
eliminate jobs. Besides contributing to unemployment, these automated workers often
exhibit inadequate job performance.
A number of jobs have been lost as a direct result of new computer technology. Ticket
agents in various transportation facilities, from subway/underground stations to airports
are virtually nonexistent these days. Bank tellers have been greatly reduced due to
automated bank machines. In addition, many call centers/centres that have help lines are
almost entirely computerized/computerised. A few years ago I worked as a helper in our
local library. Today this position does not exist, because six new computers have been
installed. The number of positions lost to computers grows exponentially, and
unemployment continues to get worse.
While a computer may easily achieve the main tasks of these jobs, most computers fall
short when customers have a unique request or problem. A pre-paid ticket booth does not
have insight about the entertainment district and cannot offer friendly directions to a
tourist. Similarly, an automated bank machine cannot provide assistance and reassurance
to a customer who has just had his credit card stolen. And, more often than not,
automated telephone operators cannot answer the one question that we have, and we
end up waiting on the line to speak with someone anyway. Every time I go into the library
where I worked I notice elderly people who don't know how to use the computers and
can't find anyone to help.
In the future, I believe a new business trend will evolve. As computers eliminate jobs, new
positions will have to be invented. More and more people will go into business for
themselves, and hopefully put the personal touch back into business. I believe that the
human workforce will demonstrate that it is more valuable than computers.
