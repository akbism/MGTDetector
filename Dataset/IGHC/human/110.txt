Some people like to live in the same house, have the same job and habits all their lives.
However, others aspire to changes and new experience. Personally, for the several
reasons, which I will explain bellow, I prefer the first approach to life.
First of all, changes in one's life bring many benefits. One tries new things, gains new
knowledge and experience. I think it is great because without changes life becomes
boring. I always try to make changes in my life. Moreover, when I feel that my life is boring
I do not feel well about it. I feel like I spent those days for nothing. I did not do anything
exiting, I learnt nothing interesting and I just waisted my time.
Second of all, people need changes. Furthermore, we need obstacles to overcome and
reach our goals. I believe that changes make us stronger, more persistent, more selfconfident, and more patient. Also, I feel that all people who succeeded in life like changes
and new experience because it is impossible to be the best at some field without
perfecting the present knowledge and gain new experience. People catch every
opportunity to learn more and change their life for the best.
From the other side, people who like their lives to stay the same are very permanent.
They have the same job all their life, the same habits, the same week-ends and even the
same years in years out. I think it is boring. What will they tell their children about their
lives? What kind of contribution will they make for the society? I think such people are just
afraid of changes.
I think curiosity and aspiration to the new experience are two of the main reasons of
human evolution. People always wanted to break limits and gain more knowledge and
experience. So, people who enjoy change are the engine of human development.
