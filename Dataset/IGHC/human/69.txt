Over the past few decades, along with growing interest in child education, people's
attention to the family environment where a child is brought up has also significantly
increased. Some people have begun to feel that a child who has grown up in a poor
family tend to be better prepared to deal with problems. In my opinion, however, family
environment alone does not much influence a child's ability to solve problems.
A child who was born into a poor family would have had more situations where they had
to solve a problem or make a decision on their own. This is because in most unfortunate
families, both parents are usually working and children are put into situations where they
have to take care of themselves. By contrast, due to their wealth, rich children can
experience and learn things that unfortunate children cannot. For example, they usually
go to the best schools and receive a higher education there, which prepares them better
for solving problems in their life.
However, few would disagree with the fact that each individual is different. That is,
problem solving skills come more from life experience. That is, the more a person
experiences in life, the more they can use these experiences to adjust, to adapt and to
solve problems they encounter. Personality also can be a factor in dealing with problems.
A person who is optimistic, outgoing, confident and open-minded can look at and solve
problems more effectively.
As discussed above, nature and nurture have an equal influence on a child's ability to
face challenges. Parents should spare no effort to figure out how they can help their
children to be independent. I hope that in the future the next generation will grow up as
mature citizens.
