Over the past few decades, there have been many advances in medical
technology. Because of this, senior citizens are healthier and more active than before and
may choose to work beyond the age of 65. Nowadays, however, there has been a
growing debate as to whether or not these people should retire in order to create jobs for
the younger generation. Despite the advantages of early retirement, I strongly believe that
it is better for senior workers to continue working as long as they are physically and
mentally capable.
Those who believe that senior workers need to retire for younger generation base their
case on the following arguments. First, the unemployment rate, especially for college
graduates, has never been so high so it is today. This is largely due to the slow economy.
Therefore, firing some elderly workers who are well-paid would allow those unemployed
young people to have good opportunities to get a job. In addition, replacing older workers
with young people would bring greater benefits to companies [=employers]. This is
because youngsters are better at adapting themselves to fast changing information based
society. They are generally better at computers and speaking foreign languages than their
older counterparts.
Nevertheless, people should not ignore the fact that senior citizens have been playing
vital roles both at home and at work for their entire lives. To begin with, a young person's
need for a job is no more important than an older person's. Both have a responsibility to
support their families. Sadly, few seniors can afford early retirement. Besides, senior
workers provide the wisdom and experience that young employees cannot offer. There is
strong [=acute] possibility of situations arising that require the knowledge of skilled senior
employees.
In summary, the advantages of keeping seasoned workers far outweigh its
disadvantages. There are high hopes that employers exercise wisdom [=caution] in
dealing with this issue.
