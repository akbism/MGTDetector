Millions of people play sport every day, and, inevitably, some suffer injury or pain. Most
players and spectators accept this risk. However, some people would like to see
dangerous sports such as boxing banned. This essay will examine some of the reasons
for banning certain sports.
Some sports are nothing but an excuse for violence. Boxing is a perfect example. The last
thing an increasingly violent world needs is more violence on our television. The sight of
two men (or even women) bleeding, with faces ripped open, trying to obliterate each other
is barbaric. Other sports, such as American football or rugby, are also barely-concealed
violence.
Some people argue that the players can choose to participate. However this is not always
the case. Many boxers, for example, come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are
lured by money or by social or peer pressure and then cannot escape. Even in richer
social groups, schools force unwilling students to play aggressive team sports, claiming
that playing will improve the students' character (or the school's reputation), but in fact
increasing the risk of injury.
Even where people can choose, they sometimes need to be protected against
themselves. Most people approve of governments' efforts to reduce smoking. In the same
way, governments need to act if there are unacceptably high levels of injuries in sports
such as football, diving, mountaineering, or motor-racing.
I accept that all sports involve challenge and risk. However violence and aggression
should not be permitted in the name of sport. Governments and individuals must act to
limit brutality and violence, so that children and adults can enjoy and benefit from sport.
