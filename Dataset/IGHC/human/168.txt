From my everyday experience and observation I think that artists as well as scientists
bring many benefits to society. It is a controversial question weather the contributions of
artists are more or less then the contributions of scientists to the society. For several
reasons, which I will mention bellow, I think that both types are valuable, priceless and
irreplaceable for every society.
The contributions of artists to the society are very essential. Art can form personâ€™s spiritual
sense, their views and personalities. People learn history, the traditions of their country
trough the art. We also watch movies that entertain and at the same time extend our
range of interests. Another important aspect of this is that art is an ancient means of
communication. In old times people depicted the herds of mammoths on the walls of their
caves. They performed different rituals around the fireplace asking their gods for health,
good harvest and weather. Our language is a result of people's need to communicate.
From the other side, the contribution of scientists is could not be exaggerated. All
humankind is indebted to the scientists because of their work and achievements.
Scientists make our life easier. We have cars and airplanes to move fast from one place
to another. We have microwaves and a bunch of preprocessed food to make the cooking
much easier. We have different devices that simplify all we do. Finally, scientists are
making great achievements in medicine that make our life longer and happier. Nowadays
people have a great opportunity to do many things faster by use of computers.
To sup up, I believe that artists nourish our souls when scientists and technology feed our
minds. So, we can not eliminate or underestimate one of them.
