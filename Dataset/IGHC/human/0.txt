There is continuous debate over preserving past historical buildings. Some prefer modern architecture and designs and bat for cheaper new buildings instead of preserving old ones. I personally disagree with this view and will further prove my point in this essay.
Some were spared the destruction and some remain as painful reminders of the regime. Historical buildings have a rich and vast history to be talked about. By visiting century old buildings or sites, people witness cityâ€™s diverse culture and complexity and this is the reason why people are attracted to historic places and buildings. Thereby attracting foreign currency and generate work for local people. It promotes growth and add value to the economy.
The historical buildings were made with high-quality construction material and by the most talented engineers of that era. For example, the temple Abu Simbel located in southern Egypt carved out of a sandstone rock cliff is a marvel piece of complex engineering. Their huge external rock relief figures have become iconic. The temple is one of the most popular tourist sites in Egypt. Such practices and materials are not really seen in modern era buildings and many historic buildings are much better than its brand new counterpart.The government can avoid costly new constructions by simply upgrading the historic buildings with relatively inexpensive modifications and converting them to hotels, coffee shops or a tourist place. Also, the government should encourage public sector undertakings and corporate houses to conserve, restore and maintainprotected buildings and sites.
To conclude, the preservation and conservation of historical buildings are in the long term interest of society.
