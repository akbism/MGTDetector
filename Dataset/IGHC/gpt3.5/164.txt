Living in a community means being part of a larger collective. It is important to give back to the community that has given us so much. That is why I have decided to give several hours of my time each month to improve the community where I live. 

I plan to volunteer my time at a local homeless shelter. Homelessness is a growing problem in my community, and I believe that by volunteering my time, I can help make a difference. I will be helping the homeless by serving meals, providing basic necessities such as clothing and toiletries, and helping them with job applications. I also plan to help the shelter with administrative tasks such as filing paperwork, answering phones, and organizing donations. 

I believe this is an important way to improve my community because it will help those who are struggling the most. Homelessness is a complex issue with many causes, and by helping those who are homeless, I can help make a positive impact in my community. Additionally, I will be providing a valuable service to those who are in need. By providing meals, clothing, and other basic necessities, I will be able to make a difference in the lives of many people. 

Finally, volunteering at a homeless shelter will also help me gain valuable experience. I will learn about the complexities of homelessness, as well as the importance of giving back to the community. I will also gain experience in working with people from different backgrounds and in different situations. 

In conclusion, I plan to volunteer my time at a local homeless shelter in order to improve my community. By providing meals, clothing, and other basic necessities, I will be able to make a difference in the lives of many people. Additionally, I will gain valuable experience by working with people from different backgrounds and in different situations.
