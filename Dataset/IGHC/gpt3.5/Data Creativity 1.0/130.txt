Retirement is an inevitable milestone in life and is usually associated with the acuteness of aging, yet there has been a lot of debate on when is the most appropriate age for compulsory retirement- should it be 55 or 65? 

Retirement not only provides a much needed respite from the burden of work, but also offers an opportunity to pursue long held ambitions. This is especially true when it comes to elderly people who are past their prime age and longing to take a break from the monotony of their jobs; for them, retirement can bring about a timely rejuvenation.

However, there are some people who reject the idea of retirement, in spite of the fact that they have reached a certain age. For instance, several folk who have secured a top notch position in their respective fields make it clear that they will continue to conduct business until their deathbed. This could be attributed to the fact that they have their entire life invested in the project and are hesitant to sever ties with it; by making retirement compulsory at a certain age they might feel theyâ€™re being deprived of a major part of their identity.

That said, having a compulsory retirement plan ensures that the workplace has improved conditions for future trainees and employees. Rejuvenation of personnel is essential to the market, because a workplace that is overstocked with aged employees might not be too conducive for learning and creativity. Furthermore, pushing elderly employees out of their assets at a pertinent age might just spur other employees to discover profitable projects and later careers before it is too late.

To sum up, the issue of a suitable retirement age may not have a clear cut answer but is something that requires thoughtful consideration. Although people should have the prerogative of determine when they can retire, having a fixed retirement age may still be pertinent in order to ensure favorable working conditions.
