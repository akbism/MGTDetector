The concept of hiring an employee for their entire lives is a rather intriguing one, as it suggests that a company has both trust and a commitment to the individual. Despite this, I do not agree that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. I believe that this practice could be outdated and could limit opportunities for younger generations. 

Firstly, hiring someone for their entire life will mean that their job security and salary are fixed, which could lead to stagnation in terms of skills and professional development. There is a risk that the employee will become less motivated and may resist the change which technology and other mutations in the market have brought. On the other hand, if employees are hired on a temporary basis, with the possibility of renewal upon expiry of their contract, these employees have an incentive to stay on top of their game by continuously updating their skills. This will in turn benefit the organisation they are working in. 

Moreover, if businesses are only hiring individuals for their entire lives, then it will prevent younger generations from entering the job market. When compared to their older counterparts, the younger ones will usually have the edge in terms of technology and new approaches to the job. If employment is for a limited period of time, more opportunities may open up for them. 

Finally, by having a temporary employee every few years, businesses are always presented with fresh perspectives. Their employees often bring in different ideas, which may be valuable for the company and can help them stay ahead of their competitors in the market. With the ever-evolving business world, this means that businesses will remain competitive and can use different strategies to stay one step ahead of their competition. 

In conclusion, I believe that businesses should not hire employees for their entire lives, and instead opt for a system which is beneficial to the employee, the business and the economy as a whole. This system should allow employees to update their skills, while giving the younger generations a fair opportunity to enter the job market, and letting the businesses to benefit from fresh ideas.
