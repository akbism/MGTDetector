The advent of television has seen drastic changes in the way we interact with our family and friends. There are several claims that television has destroyed communication among friends and family, however I disagree with this statement. 

While it is true that excessive viewing of television can have various negative impacts, I believe that television can play an important role in maintaining family and friendship communication.

To begin with, television can be an excellent source of entertainment and leisure. People can now watch shows and movies with their family and can bond over these series. This helps in having quality time with each other and can ignite conversations about common interests- something that is not always possible in today’s fast-paced life. Moreover, television can also be used to connect with family members who are geographically distant. Thanks to internet, family and friends living in different parts of the world can watch live streaming of shows, movies and even cricket and football matches together. 

Turning to friendship, it isn’t necessarily true that television has destroyed communication among friends. Although it is often associated with a couch potato lifestyle, television can also offer several avenues to interact with other friends. Internet streaming websites like Netflix, Hulu and Youtube provide options to stream directly with your friends, where you get to watch together, pause for discussions and comment on the show. It is these interactions that can help in narrowing the gap amongst friends. 

In conclusion, television can be used for good and bad. Spending excessive time in front of the television can certainly lead to negative impacts, however when used in an appropriate manner, it can be an excellent option for connecting and reconnecting with family and friends.
