Throughout the course of history, achieving a state of holistic wellness has been an aim of many societies. With the exponential growth of the modern science, the methods of curing illnesses have become increasingly sophisticated, thereby shortening the duration of healing process. Yet despite this great development in medical technology, a crucial factor remains – prevention is still better than cure.

First and foremost, preventive measures are much more cost-effective than treatments. Although the cost of prescribed medication and sometimes even diagnosis can be expensive now, the cost goes even higher when the person’s condition hasn’t improved yet. At the same time, the expense can be nonexistent if people choose to live healthily, exercise regularly, eat right, and take preventive drugs consistently. Financial stability is something necessary in order to create a safe, comfortable life, and living a healthy lifestyle helps a person achieve exactly that.

In addition to this, preventive measures for health also heighten the well-being of an individual by largely accommodating personal autonomy. Having the authority over one’s own health helps a person to maximize the potential of personal growth since one is aware of one’s own physical, mental, and emotional capabilities. Personal autonomy through preventive health management largely prevents chronic diseases, which otherwise can worsen with time and virtually hinder a person’s lifestyle.

That being said, preventive health care also turns out to be beneficial for the entire community. This is because a healthy individual speaks of a clean and functioning environment, which ultimately promotes community health. A community with healthy members encourages community engagement and participation in events, activities, and conversations about issues related to public health.

In conclusion, preventive measures for health are clearly superior to traditional cures since it serves multiple purposes. From saving costs to empowering autonomy, from protecting well-being to promoting community health, preventive health care covers much ground in terms of well-being. There is no doubt that prevention is better than cure.
