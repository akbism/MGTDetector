In today’s modern world, it has become increasingly common for popular international entertainers, including sports personalities, to receive millions of dollars in bonuses and wages in one year. While some individuals may say that these massive earnings are justified, there are some who feel that, in light of widespread poverty around the world, such sums of money are, in fact, unethical and morally unjustifiable.

On the one hand, the argument can be made that those who become international celebrities and sports stars work hard and are successful, and thus deserve to be paid exorbitant sums of money for providing the world with entertainment. They recognise the value of their contribution to society and believe that the funds they receive represent the fruits of their labour and success. Moreover, it can be argued that those earning large sums of money contribute to the local and national economies, providing jobs and income to many people.

On the other hand, it is an undeniable fact that while these celebrities and sports personalities may be living in luxury, there are still people living in hardship, poverty and deprivation all over the world. Therefore, it can be argued that such high levels of remuneration are morally unjustifiable and unethical in light of the widespread poverty and deprivation. Furthermore, the salaries and bonuses these professionals are receiving are not actually benefiting any individuals – such funds are often spent on luxury lifestyle items, such as expensive cars or properties – and not on those who really need it.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that international entertainers, including sports personalities, get massive bonuses and salaries. However, with widespread poverty around the world, such huge earnings can be deemed as unjustified and morally wrong.
