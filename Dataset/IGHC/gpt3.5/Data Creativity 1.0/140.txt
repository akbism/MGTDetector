For centuries, authors have been able to draw inspiration from their lives, or those around them, to create timeless works of literature that tell a unique story and goes over generations. But today, with the evolving market and lifestyle, these wordsmiths find themselves struggling to make ends meet, while performing their most cherished work- writing.

In such a situation, an argument can be made that the government should give these writers financial assistance to encourage great literature. There is no doubt that the written word remains one of the greatest sources of entertainment, education, or even history. They may be the only source of income for some of these authors. However, the truth is that most fiction writers go unrecognized and do not make enough money to support themselves. This means that they have to rely on other income sources such as teaching or a day job to make their living. In such a case, the government could provide some financial assistance to encourage these writers, which would in turn ensure great literature.

The government may also offer subsidies or tax benefits to authors in order to help them make a living writing. This could potentially provide the means of income they need to commit to writing full-time. Moreover, it will no doubt lead to more people entering the writing profession and subsequently, more books being published, benefiting the literary industry. This could also help to preserve and promote various forms of diverse literature, thus expounding the rich culture and heritage of a country. 

In conclusion, I believe that the government should make an effort to financially support writers of fiction. Not only will it make their lives easier and enable them to focus more on writing, it will also result in greater literary work. Even a small contribution from the government would make a huge difference in the literary industry.
