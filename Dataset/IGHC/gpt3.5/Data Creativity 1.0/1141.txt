Change is an integral part of life. Some individuals believe that staying within the same parameters is essential for leading a contented life, while others firmly maintain that change is a vital requirement for progression. This essay will discuss the merits of both these views, before settling on a resolution.

Those in favor of an unchanging life often state that it brings stability. They reason that if one sticks to a familiar routine, eventually it will become second nature: you will be able to better deal with anxiety, succeed in assigned tasks and even ward off boredom. Over time, a static lifestyle becomes comfortable, bringing with it its own rewards. A solid regimen can also bring material gains, showing itself in the form of increased savings when confined to a particular budget. 

On the contrary, proponents of change assert that it is pivotal for personal growth. They aver that taking risks and doing things out of the ordinary are essential for a fulfilled life. If a person takes a plunge and opts for unfamiliar decisions, this can result in improved knowledge and garner experience. Changing oneâ€™s lifestyle and branching out can also create new opportunities in the professional and social domain, helping an individual reach their full potential.

In conclusion, I believe that a balance should be struck between the two extremes. Too much change can be overwhelming and can lead to anxiety and confusion, while stagnation can bring about stagnation. A healthy combination of the two should be adhered to, allowing for a degree of flexibility and comfort. By incorporating enough diversity in our lives and taking on new challenges, we can experience both contentment and fulfilment.
