Immunizing children has been a hot topic of debate throughout the recent decades. All parents are obliged to provide the best and proper care for their children, and it should start with necessary vaccinations. Vaccines are seen as a safe and effective way to protect a person from a wide variety of infectious diseases. While some take a stance that vaccinations should be compulsory for all children, others believe that it is up to each individual and his/her parents to decide whether to immunize or not. In my opinion, I believe that parents must be obliged to immunize their children.

Firstly, immunization program is a successful tool for protection against serious childhood diseases. Immunization is a competent way to create a herd immunity which means that when a large portion of the population is vaccinated against a particular disease, its spread can be much lower even among individuals who are not vaccinated themselves. Vaccination will protect the child as well as whole communities. Furthermore, many of fatal childhood diseases, like polio, mumps, tetanus, and measles, can be prevented by immunization. Therefore, it is imperative that parents obligatory immunize their own children, as it is their responsibility. 

Secondly, there are certain areas of social responsibility that entail obligatory vaccination. This is particularly true for the shared environment in schools, where it is not justifiable to expose unvaccinated child to the risk of harm. Therefore, neglecting vaccination involves potential epidemic risk, as well as the possibility of violating principles of a responsible behavior in relation to innocent children. Moreover, the spread of more serious illnesses in society also presents a serious moral dilemma. 

Lastly, following the parentsâ€™ personal values and beliefs should not come at the expense of other humans. Parents need to acknowledge this before they come to a decision not to immunize their children. Immunization of children will ensure that they grow up in a much safer and healthier environment which every parent would like for their children. 

In conclusion, though there are people who believe that parents should not be obliged to immunize their children and this decision should be left up to an individual, I believe that parents should be obliged to immunize their children for quite a few reasons, primarily to protect them from potentially fatal childhood diseases and the epidemic risk amongst other children. In short, immunization is a paramount part of responsible parenting.
