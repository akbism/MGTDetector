As technology rapidly shrinks the world and transforms it into a global village, computers become important players in all facets of human life and activities. Business, hospitals, crime detection and even aircraft flying are some of the areas where the usefulness of computers is always agitating the minds of mankind. The possibilities are unlimited and technology-driven solutions are expected to extend much beyond the boundaries within which it currently exists.

It is expected that in the near future, computers will dominate many of the most essential aspects of our daily lives, helping us to further improve our lifestyle. From cars that drive themselves to buildings powered by artificial intelligence and digital assistants, the advancement of computer technology knows no bounds. With increased efficiency, speed and accuracy, machines are expected to be used for decision-making and complex programming. Additionally, the majority of online services will become automated, such as online shopping and banking.

However, there is a fear of robots taking over human jobs as they can be programmed to replicate any job. With the emergence of A.I, robots will become more sophisticated and could potentially outperform humans in any given task. This situation could lead to a situation of heightened uncertainty and possible job loss, raising ethical questions of whether computers should be given increased responsibility. 

Another major point of concern with the over-dependency on computers is the threat of cyber security. Since computers are so ingrained into our everyday lives, they pose an immense threat to our sensitive data if they are not secured properly. Hackers, phishers and viruses have caused many data breaches in the past and can be used to target individuals, corporations and government bodies. 

In conclusion, the increasing use of computers has brought about great advances in everyday life. They can be used for numerous tasks to make them more efficient and accurate. Despite this, we must remain cautious of the possible risks posed by over-dependence on this technology. It is important for individuals to stay informed about the implications of increased reliance on computers, so that both the advantages and disadvantages of this technology can be weighed up.
