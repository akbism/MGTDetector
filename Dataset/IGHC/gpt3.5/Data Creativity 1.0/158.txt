Leisure time is the period we have to ourselves to relax, unwind and take a break from our daily routine. There are two fundamentally different schools of thought when it comes to how we should spend this time. On the one hand, some people believe that leisure time should be used to stimulate the mind and engage in activities such as reading, solving crosswords and other word puzzles. On the other hand, other people feel that leisure time should be taken to give the mind some rest. 

Those who argue for using leisure time for activities that improve the mind believe that it is important that we keep our minds active and stimulate it with these kinds of activities. They argue that reading books, for example, can improve our understanding of the world and can even help us to become more creative, while doing crosswords, puzzles, and games can help to keep our minds sharp and alert. In addition, they may also argue that by challenging our minds in this way during leisure time, we can make use of our time more productively and make life more meaningful. 

However, others point out that it might be better to use leisure time to rest the mind, because our minds have been overstretched in our everyday lives. In other words, our minds may have already been exposed to too much stress and strain, so it is only natural that we should take time out from any kind of mental activity during leisure time. In this way, these people believe that some respite from our normal activities can help to recharge and refocus our minds for whatever comes next.

Having examined both sides of the argument, my opinion is that it is important to strike a balance between the two. We should use our leisure time to engage our minds in certain activities that help to improve it, such as enhancing our knowledge, improving our cognitive skills, and developing our creativity. At the same time, we should remember to take some time out to rest our minds and relax our bodies after a long day.  In this way, we can ensure that our minds are not overworked, while also using our leisure time to the best of our abilities.
