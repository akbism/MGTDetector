In recent years, sporting events in many countries been targeted by a drastic reduction in funding from the government. This essay will explore the problem of the lack of government funding for sports and suggest how we can work to solve this issue.

At its core, the issue of the lack of government funding for sports lies in skewed revenue management policies. Governments have made arrangements to prioritize main sectors such as health, security, and education adding to the already stretched budget. Consequently, sports takes a back seat in budgetary allocations leaving sports facilities and personnel vulnerable to neglect. This not only discourages participation among the youth but also causes a huge set back to the ultimate development of particular sports.

One of the best solutions to closing this gap is to facilitate private public partnership. This public-private collaboration can be beneficial for both the government as well as private enterprises as sporting activities commit huge costs towards developing its infrastructures. To maximize gains, it is important that both the sides contribute a portion of the costs towards achieving its objectives. This way, both parties can leverage the revenue generated by sports rather than depending solely on governmentâ€™s aid.

Apart from this, the governments should start focusing on Regional branding strategies by marketing local talent in the form of sports persons, venues, events etc. This way, they will be able to create a unique identity and attract more tourists, thereby enabling the local sporting sector to be effectively run. Also, another effective solution would be to abolish the high taxes levied on sports equipment and sports tickets. This move can act as a huge boost for not just encouraging people to watch sporting events but also for promoting their local teams.

In conclusion, this essay has argued for the need for efficient budget allocation for sports and has highlighted few ways we can actively contribute to saving our sports. Therefore, a comprehensive strategy comprising adequate funding and infrastructure, tax reforms and public-private partnership can help stem the declining support for sports.
