In recent years, there has been an increasing debate about whether parents or classmates have more influence on a child’s success in school. While parents are undoubtedly a guiding force in their child’s academic life, I believe that classmates have a greater influence on a child’s success in school.

Perhaps the most important point is that, while parents are able to provide guidance and a safe learning environment, classmates are able to provide real-world knowledge, tips and advice. This can be particularly important when it comes to studying new concepts or topics, as a classmate can provide insight from their own experiences and provide a student with more clarity and understanding. Similarly, a classmate’s real-world experience can also help a child to develop socially, in terms of understanding different perspectives, values and lifestyles. Close friendships with peers can also have a profoundly positive effect on a child’s attitude to their studies; with positive interactions and support, a student can become more motivated and engaged.

Moreover, a student’s academic performance is often congruent with those of their peers. A student who finds themselves in a particularly thriving learning environment, surrounded by top-performing classmates, is likely to be inspired and motivated to excel in their studies and achieve at a higher level. Furthermore, having a group of close peers to rely on can make academic hardships more bearable and can provide emotional support.

While parents can undoubtedly play an instrumental role in their child’s academic development, having an impactful support network in the form of classmates is essential in helping a child to excel. Through a combination of real-world understanding, social development, motivation and emotional support from peers, classmates can be an indispensable resource for a student’s academic success.
