It is well documented that the planet is swarming with an ever increasing amount of both organic and non-organic waste. The magnitude of the problem was established most recently by a study conducted in June 2019 using data from the Global Waste Monitor, which revealed that over two billion tonnes of waste is generated annually worldwide. As the population continues to increase and lifestyles become more developed, the number of goods produced and consumed are increasing at a concerning rate and with this, the amount of waste being produced is multiplying accordingly.

Plastic bags are one of the most damaging substances that have become increasingly ubiquitous in recent years. It is estimated that around 4 million plastic bags are disposed of every hour, meaning that they make a significant contribution to the global waste dilemma. Plastic bags not only pollute the environment and aesthetics, but also clog waterways and can take centuries to break down. In fact, recent studies have estimated that plastic could take up to 1000 years to decompose completely. The toxicity of plastic results in air and water contamination, creating hazardous conditions for our environment and many species of animals. 

Therefore, governments and corporations must recognize that much can be done to implement strategies to reduce and mitigate both the production and impact of waste material. Governments can increase taxes on plastics, impose regulations and standards, while also offering incentives and subsidies to encourage companies to reduce what they produce. On a corporate level, companies have the power to limit their packaging and its sizes. Initiatives such as ‘extended producer responsibility’, which holds corporations accountable for reducing their environmental impact, can be adopted and adopted more widely. Additionally, it is increasingly popular for consumers to opt for products with fewer packaging and environmentally friendly materials, in an effort to reduce their own contribution to the problem.

Ultimately, the solution to the challenge posed to the planet by waste materials must come from a collective effort from governments, corporations and individuals. Nevertheless, the consequences of failing to address the issue now will be felt on a global scale in the future.
