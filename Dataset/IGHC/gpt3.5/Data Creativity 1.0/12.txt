In this day and age, education abroad is increasingly accessible and thus, a growing number of parents are sending their children to study in different countries. While this is undoubtedly a beneficial trend, it does also have its detractors who argue that the associated problems outweigh the advantages. From my perspective, however, I strongly believe that the pros associated with this trend far exceed the cons, which I will address in this essay.

The primary benefit associated with studying abroad is the invaluable experience of a different culture and language. This not only provides valuable perspective on the world and helping young people become more culturally sensitive but can also lead to a greater understanding of their own culture and identity. It also allows students to be exposed to a more global educational environment, allowing them to not only learn the language of the country theyâ€™re studying in but also get accustomed to working in groups, to engage in debate and cooperative learning.

In addition, studying abroad also has the potential to open up a range of opportunities for students in terms of their future careers. It can give them access to a competitive international job market and provide them with highly transferable skills such as communication, problem-solving, teamwork, cross-cultural understanding and organization. Furthermore, the international student experience can elevate credential recognition, as many job recruiters view studying abroad as a sign of ambition, independence and maturity.

That said, there are undoubtedly some drawbacks associated with the trend of studying abroad. These include the cost of living, adjusting to a foreign environment, the potential for cultural shocks, and the fact that students will be away from home and family. Moreover, the quality of education may be lower than in their home countries, and the cost of studying abroad may be more than domestic tuition. 

Having weighed both the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad, I firmly believe that the advantages far outweigh the cons. Therefore, I would wholeheartedly encourage parents to consider sending their child to study overseas and broaden their horizon, diversifying their educational and professional portfolio.
