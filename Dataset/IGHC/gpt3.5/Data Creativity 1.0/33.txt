As times and technology become more advanced, the way people conduct business and pursue their careers is inevitably changing. This can be seen in the increase of telecommuting, which many people now use to do at least part of their work from home.


Telecommuting undoubtedly offers a wide range of advantages. Many people find they can work more concentratedly while at home due to fewer distractions like noise and colleagues. This can lead to increased productivity and, as a result, potentially higher profits for businesses. Furthermore, telecommuting also offers a degree of flexibility for workers that was previously unseen, allowing them to fit their jobs around their home lives more easily.

However, there are some potential drawbacks that may arise. Cyberspace is not as safe and secure as we would all like to believe, and as more people communicate and exchange confidential data online, potential hackers can cause havoc to companies, countries, and people. With this danger in mind, it is essential that appropriate measures are taken to ensure security in everyday communication.

In addition, the rise of telecommuting may have a significant impact on the wider society. On first sight, it appears teleworking provides efficiency and a greater degree of home and work balance for workers, which is beneficial to most. Yet upon closer inspection, anyone who does not have access to the necessary technology is naturally at a disadvantage, meaning that certain individuals may find themselves excluded from the ‘teleworkers’ community’. This could, in turn, lead to a stratification of society, and even within the working population, a division of those with and without access to this particular mode of working.

All in all, telecommuting is increasingly popular and likely to become more and more common in the coming decades. It is important, however, that proper preparations are made to ensure its benefits can be effectively maximized, while its potential pitfalls are kept to a minimum.
