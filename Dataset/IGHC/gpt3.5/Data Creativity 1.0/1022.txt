Animals have been used in testing new drugs and procedures for a long time and many people believe that it is a necessary evil in order to ensure the safety of humans. However, with the development of technology, it is becoming increasingly clear that animal testing for medical research is an inhumane and unnecessary practice. 

To begin with, the usability of animal testing in medical research has been called into question for the past couple of decades. Animal physiology is so varied and complex when compared to human physiology and their response to a given drug can be completely different. Therefore it is difficult to translate the findings from animal testing to humans, as what may be true of animals might not necessarily be applicable to us. 

Furthermore, animal testing often causes immense suffering to the animals subjected to it. Testing usually involves keeping the animals in laboratory cages and inducing them to suffer pain and stress, without being able to provide them with proper care or appear after their own interests. This is a direct violation of the animalsâ€™ rights, as they do not deserve to suffer simply for the benefit of humans.

Finally, current sophisticated methods of testing drugs in humans and computer simulations have largely superseded animal testing for medical research. For instance, human cell cultures, computer models and other advances in medicine have brought us closer to a compassionate, humane and more accurate alternative than testing on animals. Additionally, such methods of testing diminish the risk of damage to humans, providing a more reliable way of assessing the safety of drugs.

In conclusion, while animal testing has traditionally been an accepted practice, the advances of technology have made it obsolete and an inhumane practice. For this reason, governments and research agencies should provide additional investment and resources to alternative methods, in order to ensure a smooth and ethical transition away from animal experimentation.
