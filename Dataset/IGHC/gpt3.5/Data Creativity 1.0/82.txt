Marriage is a vital decision for both the individuals and their families involved in the union. In many countries, especially in the eastern culture, parents are held with great responsibility to arrange for their children’s marriages, while in the western society, it is solely left to the person to choose their own partner. Both systems have their own pros and cons to consider. 

Under the parental arrangement system, the parents are experienced and can use the collective support of their relatives and the extended family when it comes to finding a suitable partner for the child. The parents try to find a match in terms of compatibility, financial background, and other criteria to ensure a successful marriage. Not only do they find a good match, but parents also provide their children with much-needed emotional support when it comes to adjusting to their new life. On the other hand, this arrangement system sometimes puts restrictions on the freedom of choice of their child which can be cruel if their child is in love with someone else. 

With the self-selected marriage system, the burden of finding a suitable partner is shifted to the individual themselves. This gives them much more freedom to choose a person according to their expectations, values and aspirations. They have their own space to explore, find and decide on their own decision regarding marriage. This system boasts of its independence and freedom, however, it lacks the experienced advice from the elders of the family, which may be important for a happy married life.

In conclusion, both the marriage systems have their pros and cons. The decision should be made based on the best of the individual’s interest and taking advice from the family or trusted social group. While the self-selected partner system offers more freedom. the arranged marriage system is capable of bringing parent’s experience into play.
