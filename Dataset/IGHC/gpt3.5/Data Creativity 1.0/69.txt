The debate on whether children born into families with limited financial means, or high finanical means, fare better when facing problems in adulthood has long existed. While some may argue that wealthy parents, and an abundance of resources, are better for a child’s development, I beg to disagree. I strongly believe that, in comparison, children from families with limited finances are far better prepared to handle difficult situations in adulthood than those from wealthy backgrounds.

Primarily, a lack of financial resources forces children to learn how to be innovative, and how to get out of tight spots as they come. In simpler words, when it comes to resources, children from underprivileged backgrounds are forced to ‘make do with what you have’. For example, many orphanages and homeless shelters often have limited equipment, and children living there have to find creative solutions to the problem at hand. This resourcefulness and problem-solving skills become extremely useful in adulthood when they encounter difficulties. On that note, I remember reading an article about a particular homeless shelter having constant electricity problems, which forced the children living there to learn computer coding to solve the problem. Little did they know, these coding skills later helped them secure jobs in the software industry. Thus, it can be seen that the lack of resources can, in fact, be an advantage, as it reinforces creative and innovative abilities.

Moreover, children from high-income backgrounds tend to be sheltered from the harsh realities of the world, and are largely kept away from difficult situations. This lack of exposure and realism may lead them to become overly dependent on others in adulthood when they encounter such situations, making them people ill-equipped to handle the situation. This can drive them to indulge in escapist behavior, or become prone to anxiety and depression when challenged with difficult life circumstances. On the contrary, children from families with limited finances are given the opportunity to learn and understand the real world, and how to interact with it. They gain financial understanding, communication skills and how to interact with people of different socioeconomic standings. These are the skills that enable them to be more independent and capable of making decisions with more confidence and accuracy. 

To conclude, it is clear that when it comes to adulthood, children from lower-income families are far more apt at dealing with difficulties than those with more privileged backgrounds. The lack of resources encourage innovation and problem solving skills, as well as allowing them to gain an understanding of the harsh realities of the real world. Though this may not be the case in all instances, it is easy to see how, most of the time, children of families with fewer resources are better prepared for adulthood.
