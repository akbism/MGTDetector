In today's world, many countries have put into place programmes that encourage young people to work or travel for a year before they start university. This can give them invaluable insight into the world and future career prospects, yet come with a number of potential dangers and drawbacks as well. 

Certainly, taking a gap year before university can have a number of advantages. Firstly, it provides the opportunity to travel extensively, meet new people and experience diverse cultures. In doing so, young people can expand their horizons, learn extremely useful life lessons and develop maturity that would not otherwise be achieved. Moreover, in many countries, it can be an ideal way for young people to gain valuable practical experience and qualifications, often in the form of internships or apprenticeships.

That being said, spending a year away from university study can also come with significant negatives. The most obvious one is the large financial cost involved in travelling and living expenses during the year. Many families simply do not have the necessary funds so this can be a real barrier to those less well-off. Another danger is that young people become so involved in the experience that there is no longer any motivation for them to return to course study and possibly continue realising their ambitions.

In conclusion, as young people can gain valuable experiences, wisdom and qualifications by taking a gap year, it is understandable why it has become so popular. Nonetheless, the financial cost and lack of focus can make it a difficult process that needs to be undertaken with caution.
