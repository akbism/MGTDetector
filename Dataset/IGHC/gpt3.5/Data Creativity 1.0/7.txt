The world today is increasingly focusing on higher education as a means to secure a successful career and life. But with the traditional path of finishing high school and then immediately undertaking university studies proving ever more costly, an alternative is often posed – travel or work for a period of time before taking the plunge into tertiary education. Both options invite debate amongst educationalists, employers and students. On the one hand, it is argued that taking a break from studies offers valuable skills development and a chance to recharge the academic batteries; on the other hand, concerns are expressed about the potential to lose motivation and focus. 

Undoubtedly, undertaking travel or work for a time after high school has its advantages. To begin with, students have the opportunity to gain practical skills from their experiences and apply this knowledge to their future university studies. In addition, the time away from school allows them to test their knowledge and apply the concepts that have already been learnt, something that is very difficult to do in the controlled conditions of a school or university campus. Beyond this, it is argued that break after high school could bring a more holistic education. This is because it gives the student the chance to immerse themselves in a new culture, exposing them to new lifestyles and experiences. Partaking in such activities often provides the foundations for an enriched experience in the classroom, helping emerging students to draw parallels between their life and the subject matter being studied. 

On the flipside, delaying university enrolment can cause a number of pitfalls. Firstly, there is the risk of the student’s academic performance diminishing as they are not keeping their minds active and up to date with the latest knowledge developments. In addition, there is a fear that taking a prolonged break from studies could potentially result in the student losing their motivation over time, and upon their return to the classroom, they may not have the momentum or enthusiasm to effectively engage. Furthermore, an extended absence from academia is often seen as a red flag for future employers, who may be reluctant to hire an individual with a large gap in their academic history. 

All things considered, there are both positives and negatives to taking a break from academics after finishing high school. I personally believe that this option depends largely on the individual and their areas of interest and ambition. For instance, a student who is passionate about gaining as much practical knowledge should seek travel or work to build on their skillset; while those looking to perform well in their academic studies should enrol in university as soon as possible.  Ultimately, the best option is to weigh up the pros and cons and decide what the best choice is.
