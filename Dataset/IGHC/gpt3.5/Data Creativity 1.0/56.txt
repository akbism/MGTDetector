Formal education has always been a hot debate among parents and educationists, especially when it comes to starting age of children. Some people advocate starting early formal education as they think young children should focus on school studies more than playing. On the other hand, few others hold the opinion that young kids should spend most of their time in outdoor activities like playing. 

At the early stage of life, children need knowledge but they also need to understand life experiences. Education is the basis of building a strong foundation of understanding, but playtime gives them a chance to practically apply the learning in their day-to-day life. For example, playing games gives children an opportunity to learn the scope of sharing and competition. Therefore, I think starting formal education at a very early age along with close supervision of playtime would be the most beneficial approach. 

Formal education from an early age gives children the advantage of learning the basics of arithmetic and language, enabling them to build a strong learning foundation for their future. Moreover, as children advance in school, formal education can also help to mature kids mentally and emotionally, which is diversely important for their growth. Learning new things in an organized way helps children take up challenges in later stages of their life. 

On the other hand, playtime activities help children to be more physically fit and active. It also increases their creativity and teaches the value of sharing and team work. Hence, playing have its own benefit in moulding the life of children. But there should also be a balance between both activities. 

In conclusion, I think combining both formal education and playtime would be the better approach for the development of children. Parents should ensure that their children learn the basics of education and at the same time, should also give them ample opportunity to involve in play activities. This way children will be able to develop strong learning foundation and still be free to explore the world with their involvement in playtime facilities.
