In recent years, modern society has been increasingly acknowledging the importance of both motherhood and fatherhood. It is argued that because the burden of deciding to give birth is placed primarily on the mother’s shoulders, the responsibility of raising the child is also thrust upon her. However, I maintain that both motherhood and fatherhood should be emphasised equally, and that fathers should in no way be exempted from playing a vital role in raising their children. 

First and foremost, fathers must be praised for their vital support when it comes to pregnancy and childbirth. Fathers traditionally act as a source of physical, mental, and emotional support for the mothers — especially first-time mothers — supplying them with whatever needs they may require. They are often the ones to provide unexpected but much-needed comfort in difficult situations throughout the entire period of pregnancy. However, such assistance should not end there, and the role of men in the parenting process should not be overlooked. 

Fathers should be rewarded for the invaluable part they play in raising the children — teaching them skills, influencing their behaviour and values, and providing financial and emotional security. It is indeed true that mothers have a greater capacity for being emotionally attached to their children, as they have sustained contact with the child from the moment of conception. However, when it comes to imparting discipline and practical understanding, fathers also play an important role in forming the children into capable and valuable individuals.

To conclude, rather than belittling the role of fathers, it is essential that both motherhood and fatherhood be recognised and celebrated equally. After all, raising children is a collective effort requiring complementary roles. Men should not be absolved of such responsibility — especially when a child is of an age when maximum attention is needed — as it could lead to a more acute sense of exclusion than that felt through motherhood alone.
