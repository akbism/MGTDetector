Modern buildings have come to resemble one another and cities across the world are rapidly losing their individuality due to advancements in technology and transportation. This homogenization of architecture is often perceived as a loss, as the identity of a place and its culture are swept away. However, as with most issues, there is an upside to this trend as well. 

The primary reason that modern cities are becoming more and more similar, is the increasing flow of global capital and populations. Advancements in transportation and technology, such as cars and the internet, have enabled global businesses to flourish, while allowing people to live and work in more remote areas. This makes it easier for companies to build the same type of buildings, wherever they are in the world. In addition, the rise of global conglomerates means that one company may have a presence in a variety of countries, and thus, utilize similar buildings in all of their locations. 

In certain respects, this homogeneity of architecture can be seen as a good thing. It fosters an international understanding and a sense of camaraderie between different countries and cultures. Additionally, it makes it easier for people to move from one place to another, as buildings become more familiar, despite the vast distances between them. Furthermore, building costs can be kept low, and cities can benefit from facilities that offer professional services and efficient public spaces. 

On the other hand, too much similarity taken away from the uniqueness of a place, and homogenization of architecture can make it difficult to understand the history and culture of a place. This can especially be seen in older cities, which were once unique and beautiful but now resemble any other city in the world. Moreover, the disregard for local building norms and materials often leads to the destruction of the environment and local culture.

In conclusion, it can be said that modern cities are becoming increasingly similar due to global mobility and capital, however, this is a double-edged sword. The homogenization of architecture can have both positive and negative effects on the people that inhabit it.
