Nowadays, there has been a noticeable change in dietary habits and lifestyle of contemporary children in comparison to their predecessors. While some people argue that this has detrimentally affected the overall health of children, I disagree with this point of view.

To begin with, compared to past generations, children in the current era are better educated about healthy eating and lifestyle practices. Parents, schools and public health campaigns have all been essential in educating children on making the right dietary choices and avoiding lifestyles that are detrimental to their health. In addition, a recent UNESCO report suggests that parents are increasingly interested in making healthier food options available to their children. With more access to healthier and nutritious food, children today are much more accustomed to nutritionally-balanced meals. This is good news in terms of their overall health as nutritious food sets them up for better physical as well as mental development.

On the other hand, it is argued that children in today’s world have more access to fast food and unhealthy snacks than before. Also, with the increasing demands of modern day society, children have started to lead a more sedentary life than before. Such detrimental eating and lifestyle habits can lead to a range of health problems which can have long-term adverse effects. While this is certainly true, it is important to note that these issues still remain under the control of the parents. There is still plenty of potential to raise healthy and fit children, if proper guidance and education is provided from the early years.

In conclusion, I believe that there is a stark difference between current eating and lifestyle habits of children compared to the past generations, but it is the responsibility of the parents and society to ensure that such changes are for the betterment of children’s health. Therefore, I disagree with the opinion that children’s health has been deteriorated due to changes in their dietary habits and lifestyle.
