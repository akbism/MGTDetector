The importance of establishing rules and regulations for children and instilling discipline into their code of conduct is a timeless discussion topic. As there is tremendous variation in the degree of discipline a child receives in different countries, it can be argued that there is no right or wrong approach in defining a tangible line between disciplining children and allowing them their own freedom. 

It can be suggested that allowing children to learn and grow in an unrestricted environment may help them refine their personal and social skills, build independence and launch successful careers in later life. To this end, children should not be overly restricted with guidelines that limit their ability to explore aspects of their being effectively. 

On the other hand, it is also essential to provide children with some clearly-defined rules of behaviour as this enables them to develop a sense of responsibility and develop responsibility for their actions. This is reflected in the fact that children are provided with an education in school and at home so they may learn to abide by the social, moral and legal codes in society. Teaching children polite language, proper communication and other life skills are examples of ways in which parents and guardians can provide children with structured rules and guidelines. 

In conclusion, it is evident that children should have a balance of freedom and constraints in order to develop their physical, social and cognitive skills appropriately. Where possible, rules and regulations need to be carefully crafted with the child's best interest in mind and agreeable to the child's guardians and carers. This will ensure that the child receives a measured and comprehensive approach in developing their personal and social skills in a healthy, safe environment.
