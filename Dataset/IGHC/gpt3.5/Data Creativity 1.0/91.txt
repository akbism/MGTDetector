The sale and consumption of both heroin and tobacco are strictly prohibited in many countries around the world as both these substances have serious physical and psychological repercussions for the users. The question whether the same laws prohibiting the sale and consumption of heroin should also be applied to tobacco has been a source of debate for a long time. Both sides of the argument have valid points to make. 

Those arguing against applying the same laws to tobacco argue that tobacco is not nearly as damaging or addictive as other substances like heroin. While they are not denying that tobacco can have serious consequences on a personâ€™s health, they argue that the harms caused by tobacco can be minimized through public education and awareness campaigns. Moreover, as tobacco is widely available, completely outlawing it would mean a significant loss of income to the government through taxes.

On the other hand, those arguing in support of applying the same laws to tobacco argue that it is one of the leading causes of cancer and health issues across the world. Banning the sale and consumption of tobacco to a significant extent would result in improved public health. Moreover, the government can find other ways to make up for the income generated from taxes on tobacco.

When it comes to protecting public health from the harms caused by certain substances, both heroin and tobacco need to be treated equally in terms of the laws prohibiting their sale and consumption. Hence, the same set of laws should be applied to both substances. However, given that heroin is far more addictive and damaging than tobacco, the enforcement of those laws should be stricter when it comes to heroin. Thus, different levels of penalties should be given for selling and consuming heroin as compared to tobacco.
