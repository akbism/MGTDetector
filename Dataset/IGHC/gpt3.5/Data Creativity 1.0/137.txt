The debated issue of whether the government should invest more on medical care and education rather than sports stadiums and theatres has been a source of contention for many years. On one hand, insufficient resources for these basic needs of people should be spent but on the other hand, the entertainment sources can never be neglected either. 

For the provision of basic needs of people, government should definitely put more emphasis on the medical care and education. Many people in the world do not have access to proper medical facilities or even the basic necessities to educate themselves or receive quality education. Investing in these areas can bring many positive changes to the society. People could become healthier if they are provided with suitable medical treatments or have improved access to quality healthcare services. Additionally, improved educational facilities can help people acquire the necessary skills and knowledge that can aid in their overall development. Thus, government should put their resources more in medical care and education to help improve the overall condition of the people. 

However, the world would be too dull and boring if the government completely ignores investing in the building of theatres and sports stadiums. Theatre and sports contribute immensely to our entertainment and culture. Theatre allows us to explore human relationships and deeper aspects of life. It helps in spreading the art of storytelling and encourages people to look into their souls. Likewise, sports helps to build a sense of camaraderie among the citizens and teach us how to respect and act in unity. Even the historic grandeur of Shakespeare and the Olympics showcases the gratifying part of human life which should not be forsaken. 

In conclusion, I believe that a balance between these two areas should be created while considering the resources and needs of people. Government must invest in both medical care, education and entertaining activities like theatres and sports stadiums to not only provide basic needs to the people but also to make the life of people more enjoyable.
