Technology brings a considerable amount of convenience to our lives. From shopping online to staying connected with friends and family, the effects of technology have been prolific and omnipresent in the modern world. Computer usage is no exception. Over the years, there has been a gradual increase in dependency on computers for everyday tasks. They are now essential elements used in businesses, hospitals, crime detection, and even in the cockpit of airplanes. 

The integration of computers into the various departments of businesses has enabled unparalleled efficiency and performance. It ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability to daily operations. Computers help store large quantities of data in a secure cloud-like system which can be easily accessed by multiple outlets. Furthermore, with advances in artificial intelligence and neural nets, computers are making decisions that once required complex problem solving.

Working at a rapid pace, hospitals have taken advantage of the increased precision and accuracy of computers along with their power to store and process large amounts of data. Due to the enormous amount of medical records, computers have made it easier to track, update, and access records crucial for making life-saving decisions. Moreover, computer-aided technologies like CAT scans, ultrasounds and X-rays further assist with quicker and precise diagnoses.

Modern systems of crime detection have also significantly improved due to computers and the vast amount of networked data. Not only can databases be constantly updated to match the information with ongoing investigations, but computer systems with facial and voice recognition capabilities are also now in use. Furthermore, data analytics are used to study online gambling, terrorism, and financial fraud.

Even in the high-stakes aviation industry, pilots are now depending on computers in a much higher capacity. With sophisticated navigation systems, they can easily maneuver around turbulent skies while avoiding hazardous conditions. Additionally, with backup systems and automated takeoff protocols, computers provide a much safer working environment for pilots.

It is clear that computers play an integral role in our lives. With that being said, it is crucially important to stay aware and informed about the modern advancements in computing that are impacting many industries significantly. Moreover, businesses must ensure that it is used responsibly, as the security of confidential data and information is of utmost priority. With the trend of increasing computer dependency, it is necessary to remain vigilant and use it effectively.
