Competition and cooperation are two essential elements of any successful society. While some people believe that competition should be encouraged in children to foster a sense of ambition and drive, others argue that teaching children to cooperate rather than compete is more beneficial for their development. This essay will discuss both views and will provide a personal opinion.

Competition has been a part of human nature since the dawn of time. Encouraging it in children can help them to develop important skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and strategic planning. It can also help them to become more ambitious and driven, thus helping them to achieve their goals. Furthermore, children who are taught to compete from an early age are more likely to be successful in their future endeavors.

On the other hand, cooperation is also an important part of any society. Teaching children to cooperate rather than compete can help them to develop important social skills such as communication, negotiation and collaboration. Cooperation can also help children to understand the importance of working together and can help them to become more empathetic towards others. In addition, cooperation can help children to build strong relationships with their peers, which is essential for their personal growth.

In my opinion, both competition and cooperation are important for the development of children. While competition can help children to develop important skills and become more ambitious, cooperation can help them to develop social skills and build strong relationships with their peers. Therefore, I believe that both competition and cooperation should be encouraged in children in order to foster a balanced development.
