The debate over whether children who are brought up in a family with less money are better equipped to handle problems in adulthood compared to those who are brought up in a wealthy family is an ongoing one. While some may argue that those who come from a less privileged background have to face more hardships, and hence, are better prepared to handle the struggles of adulthood, I believe that both types of upbringing can prepare children for their future. 

To begin with, it is true that children from less privileged backgrounds have to face more difficulties and hardships in life, thus, they learn to be resilient from an early age. They learn to be independent and take responsibility for their own actions. Moreover, since they are used to living with fewer resources, they develop a sense of frugality and understand the importance of money. This helps them in the long run as they are better able to manage their finances in adulthood. 

On the other hand, those who are brought up in a wealthy family have their own advantages. They have access to more resources and a better quality of life. This allows them to focus more on their studies and extracurricular activities. They learn to think out of the box and develop problem-solving skills. This helps them to become more creative and innovative in their professional life. 

From my own experience, I can say that both types of upbringing can prepare children for their future. My father, who comes from a lower-middle-class family, taught me the importance of hard work and financial discipline. On the other hand, my mother, who comes from a wealthy family, taught me how to think out of the box and be creative. These two aspects of my upbringing have helped me to become successful in my professional life. 

In conclusion, I believe that both types of upbringing can prepare children for their future. Children from less privileged backgrounds learn to be independent and develop financial discipline, while those from wealthy families learn to think out of the box and develop problem-solving skills. Thus, both types of upbringing have their own advantages and can help children to become successful in their future.
