In the modern world, it is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increased prevalence of technology, the rise of the nuclear family, and the growing prevalence of individualism. 

The increased prevalence of technology has had a significant impact on the closeness of modern families. With the rise of social media, families are no longer limited to face-to-face communication as a means of staying connected. This has led to a decrease in the amount of meaningful communication and physical contact between family members. Furthermore, the prevalence of technology has also led to an increase in the amount of time that family members spend on their devices, rather than engaging in meaningful conversations and activities with each other. 

The rise of the nuclear family has also had an impact on the closeness of modern families. With the advent of dual-income households, both parents are often working full-time and have less time to spend with their children. This lack of time together has contributed to a decrease in the closeness of modern families. 

Finally, the growing prevalence of individualism has also had an impact on the closeness of modern families. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on individual achievements, rather than collective accomplishments. This has led to a decrease in the amount of time that family members spend together, as individuals are more focused on their own pursuits. 

In order to combat the decline in the closeness of modern families, there are a number of measures that can be taken. Firstly, families should make an effort to set aside time to spend together. This could include regular family dinners, weekend outings, or simply carving out time for meaningful conversations. Secondly, families should strive to limit the amount of time that they spend on their devices, and instead focus on fostering meaningful relationships with each other. Finally, families should strive to celebrate collective accomplishments, rather than individual achievements. This could include celebrating holidays or birthdays together, or simply taking the time to recognize the accomplishments of each family member. 

In conclusion, it is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increased prevalence of technology, the rise of the nuclear family, and the growing prevalence of individualism. However, by making an effort to set aside time to spend together, limiting the amount of time spent on devices, and celebrating collective accomplishments, families can strive to become closer and more connected.
