Change is an inevitable process of life and it occurs in a variety of ways - from subtle shifts to dramatic turns. Depending on personal view, some people may favour to stay in routine and keep their lives steady-state, while others may embrace the recurring transformation that life brings. 

For those people welcoming a continuous change, the ability to expand their self-awareness and grow beyond their self-imposed boxes is what encourage them to embark on the journey of self-discovery. As such it affords them the opportunity to experiment with different activities in order to build desired skills, pursue new career paths and insight into physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the world we live in. Consequently, these people can often feel more invigorated and satisfied with the versatility of life.

On the other hand, there are those people who choose a life of durability and stay away from uncertainty and insecurity brought by unpredictability of life changes. These people experience a sense of stability with moments of joy as they already familiarize with events, places and persons. By keeping away from discomfort of change they can steadily explore their inner strengths and weaknesses, as well as identify trajectories of life that bring them the most satisfaction.

In my opinion, I believe that for one to satisfy the needs of their lives it is essential to recognize the balance between the change and routine. Although in the fast-paced world of today the importance of change is demonstrated, stability and consistency is still of great importance in order to establish a sense of continuity in life. Therefore, it is only with a steady frame of mind that we may aspire to reach our goals, while altering our perceptions further along with the changes. 
 
All things considered, it is apparent that different people have different opinions regarding change in life. Furthermore, the right attitude to view change is to recognize it as part of our natural progression, where we explore the potential of growth for a more fulfilled life.
