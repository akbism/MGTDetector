Dangerous sports can be defined as activities that leave participants vulnerable to physical injury or death and therefore, bear inherent risks of extreme harm. Such activities include rodeos, mountaineering, and skydiving, to name a few. There has been a long-running debate on whether these sports should be banned or not. In my opinion, it would be unjustified and unfair to impose a ban on dangerous sports.

Firstly, without any doubt, an individual intending to participate in a dangerous sport should be well aware of the risks and the potential harm associated with it. So, it is the responsibility of the participant to think responsibly and make an informed decision to participate or not. A ban on dangerous sports would be curtailing this personal choice, and thus, threatening the basic fundamental right of freedom of choice. 

The second argument in favor of not banning dangerous sports is that such activities promote a culture of resilience and create an opportunity to develop creative ways of problem-solving. Skydiving, for example, can teach participants to be alert and mindful of their physical environment; and to identify potential problems and develop solutions to overcome them.

Thirdly, the dangers posed by certain sports, while real, do not constitute a public danger. Therefore, a blanket ban on the said activities would be unnecessary. The onus to protect participants lies on the organisers and practitioners of such activities by following all relevant safety guidelines, and no amount of regulation can substitute individual responsibility and precaution.

In conclusion, imposing a complete ban on dangerous sports would be counterproductive as participants should be free to decide for themselves whether or not to participate in such activities. Such activitiesform a necessary part of the overall culture and, when performed in a regulated manner, can even help participants develop useful skills.
