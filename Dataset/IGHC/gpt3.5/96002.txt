Immunisation is an important part of modern healthcare, providing protection against a wide range of diseases. In the past, many children have suffered and even died from diseases that could have been prevented by immunisation. This has led to the question of whether parents should be obliged to immunise their children against childhood diseases or whether individuals have the right to choose not to immunise their children. 

On one hand, there are those who argue that parents should be obliged to immunise their children against childhood diseases. The main argument in favour of this is that immunisation is the best way to protect children from serious illnesses, and that by not immunising, parents are putting their children at risk of contracting serious and potentially fatal diseases. In addition, there is a public health argument in favour of immunisation, as it helps to protect the wider community by reducing the spread of disease.

On the other hand, there are those who argue that individuals have the right to choose not to immunise their children. This argument is based on the idea that individuals should have the freedom to make decisions about their own health, and that it is not the place of the government to dictate what people should or should not do. In addition, some argue that there is a lack of scientific evidence to support the efficacy of immunisation, and that there are potential risks associated with immunisation which parents should have the right to choose not to take. 

In conclusion, while there are arguments both for and against immunisation, it is clear that the decision of whether or not to immunise should be left to the individual. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of parents to make informed decisions about their children's health and to weigh up the risks and benefits of immunisation before making a decision.
