International tourism has become one of the biggest industries in the world, with people travelling to different countries to experience their culture, cuisine and attractions. However, it is true that international tourism can create tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures. 

In some cases, tourists may not be aware of the local customs and culture, and this can lead to misunderstandings. For example, tourists may dress inappropriately or not show respect to local religious sites. This can create tension between tourists and locals, which can lead to further cultural divides. 

Furthermore, international tourism can also lead to economic tension. Tourists may not be aware of the local prices and may be charged more than locals. This can create a sense of unfairness and resentment, which can lead to further tension between tourists and locals. 

On the other hand, international tourism can also bring people from different cultures together. Tourists may be exposed to different cultures and customs, which can lead to greater understanding and appreciation. For example, tourists may learn about local cuisine, customs and traditions, which can create a sense of mutual respect and understanding. 

In conclusion, while it is true that international tourism can create tension between people from different cultures, it can also lead to greater understanding and appreciation. It is therefore important for tourists to be aware of local customs and etiquette, and to show respect to locals, in order to create a positive experience for all involved.
