In today's world, we are producing more and more rubbish. This phenomenon is due to several factors. Firstly, people have become more dependent on disposable products, such as plastic containers, paper cups and plastic bags. These products are convenient and inexpensive, but they are not biodegradable and can accumulate in landfills for centuries. Secondly, the population is growing rapidly and this means more people are using more products and generating more waste. Finally, the production of goods has increased dramatically due to globalisation and the industrialisation of many countries.

There are several measures that governments can take to reduce the amount of rubbish produced. Firstly, they can introduce legislation that requires manufacturers to use recyclable materials and eco-friendly packaging. This will reduce the amount of non-recyclable waste that is produced. Secondly, governments can introduce incentives for people to reduce their consumption of disposable products and encourage them to use reusable items instead. Finally, governments can invest in waste management systems, such as composting and recycling facilities, to ensure that the waste that is produced is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.

In conclusion, the amount of rubbish produced is increasing due to several factors. Governments must take action to reduce the amount of rubbish produced by introducing legislation, incentives and waste management systems.
