News editors are responsible for deciding what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. They are expected to select stories that will be of interest to their target audience. The factors that influence their decisions vary depending on the type of news outlet, but some of the most important considerations include the relevance of the story, its timeliness, the potential for controversy, and the potential for audience engagement. 

The media has a responsibility to report on important news stories, but it is also important that they consider the impact that their reporting may have on their viewers or readers. It is not uncommon for news outlets to focus on negative stories, as these tend to generate more attention and discussion. This can lead to an over-emphasis on negative stories, which can lead to viewers and readers becoming desensitized to bad news. 

It is important that news outlets also report on positive stories, as this can help to counterbalance the negative stories and provide viewers and readers with a more balanced view of the world. Positive stories can help to provide hope in difficult times and can help to inspire people to take action and make a difference. Positive stories can also help to reduce feelings of helplessness and isolation by showing that there are people out there who are working hard to make the world a better place. 

In conclusion, news editors have a responsibility to report on both positive and negative stories, as this helps to provide viewers and readers with a balanced view of the world. It is important that news outlets consider the potential impact of their reporting and strive to provide viewers and readers with stories that can help to inspire and motivate them.
