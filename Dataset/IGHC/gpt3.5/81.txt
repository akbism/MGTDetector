The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is a highly controversial issue that has been debated by various stakeholders for decades. Proponents of capital punishment argue that it is an effective measure to control violence in society and make peopleâ€™s lives more secure, while opponents argue that it is a cruel and inhumane practice that should be abolished. In my opinion, capital punishment should not be used as a tool to control violence in society, as it has been proven to be ineffective in deterring crime and it has been linked to miscarriages of justice.

Firstly, there is no evidence to suggest that capital punishment is an effective deterrent for crime. Studies have shown that countries which have abolished the death penalty have experienced a decrease in the number of violent crimes. This suggests that capital punishment is not an effective measure to control violence in society. Furthermore, the death penalty has been linked to miscarriages of justice, as innocent people have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death in the past. This is a clear violation of human rights and should not be tolerated.

In conclusion, while it is true that capital punishment can be used to punish people who have committed serious crimes, it is not an effective measure to control violence in society. It has been proven to be ineffective in deterring crime and it has been linked to miscarriages of justice. Therefore, I disagree with the opinion that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society.
