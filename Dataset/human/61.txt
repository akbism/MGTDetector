The issue about whether children should help with household tasks as soon as they are
able to do so is open for debate. Some people say that children should devote more time
for playing with their friends, watching TV and studying. However, other people believe
that children should help their parents with household tasks. Personally, for several
reasons, which I will explain bellow, I adhere to the latter point of view.
First of all, I think that every child should have his or her own responsibilities. When I was
a child my parents taught me how to make breakfast in the morning. So, I woke up, went
to the kitchen and prepared a couple of toasts for breakfast. It was easy and I enjoyed
doing it because I liked the way my parents thanked me and I felt that they were proud of
me. Also, my mom always wanted me to know how to cook, clean and iron my cloth.
Thanks to the learning, nowadays, when my maid can not come to my house I handle all
household tasks myself.
Second of all, performing household tasks teaches children to value the job of people who
did it. When I was a child I did not imagine that cleaning house could be so time and
energy consuming. So, when I began to do some of the household tasks by myself I
began to respect the job of others and tryed to collect all my toys after my playing with
them.
Finally, doing household tasks teaches children to arrange their time. In addition to those
practical benefits, help from children allows parents to have more spare time for their
personal lives and for the children. A family can have more time to spend with each other
talking, watching movies or just enjoying the beautiful moments.
To sum up, I think that children should help their parents with household tasks. Doing
household tasks helps them to grow into independent, self-confident, and attentive
persons who respect their parents.
