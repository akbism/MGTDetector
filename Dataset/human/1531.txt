The more people that there are in the world, the more cars there are on the road. People
are richer too and often families have more than one car. It has been proved that building
more roads does not work; it just encourafes more traffic.
So, what can we do? People like their cars and the freedom and independence that cars
give them. One possibility would be to raise car taxes and fuel taxes so that people do not
want to spend the extra money. Taxes on new car sales as well could be increased in
order to discourage people from buying. Perhaps a used car sales tax could be
introduced too. In the same way motorways could have tolls charged for using them
although this may just increase congestion on smaller roads as people try and avoid the
motorways. The government that introduces such ideas will not be popular though and
would probably lose power. Governments would therefore be unlikely to set up such new
measures. 
I think it would be better to try and change people‛s attitudes and offer them alternatives.
Educate them more about the pollution and waste that they are causing. Persuade them
to car share, use public transport or even cycle if the distances are not too long. Countries
such as Holland and Denmark are well known for how their citizens are passionate about
green issues and how they use bicycles when they can.
Reducing traffic is a difficult task. I don‛t think it is possible realistically to reduce car
numbers but I do think that we can change people‛s attitudes and get them to use
different ways of travelling.
