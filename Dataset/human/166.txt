Traveling is a good way to find out more about different countries with different traditions
and customs. Some travelers prefer to spend in one country just a few days or one day
and then leave for another country. This way of traveling allows people to visit more
countries in fewer days. Unfortunately, in this case such travelers have to hurry in order to
visit more places.
I am from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. So, if a foreign visitor has only one day to spend in
my country I think I would advice him to visit the "Hermitage" - the most well known and
amazing museum in Russia. The "Hermitage" has 3 floors and more then 100 halls. It is
really amazing to visit that place. Many people from all over the world every day enter its
walls. Some of the rooms devoted to the history of other countries. Others devoted to the
art of a famous painter and the history of his life. However, most of the halls conclude
many things such as paintings, royal belongings, sculptures from Russian history.
Some people say that it is impossible to feel deeply and see all these amazing historical
values for one visit. I have to completely agree with this statement. When I first visited the
"Hermitage" I was 14 years old. It impressed me so much that I was back next day to see
what I had not been able to see the day before.
The "Hermitage" is an impressive and beautiful museum. I think it is worth to spend there
a whole day and I believe that after that a foreign visitor can claim with a proud that he or
she saw Russia.
