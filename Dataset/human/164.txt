I think the question what would I do if I had a chance to improve my community is difficult.
I have in my mind many things, the improvement of which will make our community better
place to live but they all require the participation of many people and, moreover, they
require investments, which I can not provide. For example, my community is quite noisy.
We have the huge mall just in front of our community, so traffic jams are very common for
this place. I think that the construction of a few pass-by roads will benefit all people who
live here as well as people who drive by every day.
Unfortunately, the question is what I can do for my community giving a few hours of my
time every month. I think I can not do much, but I still can help someone in my
community. For example, I can baby-sit. I know a couple of families with little children,
who can not afford to spend much money on the baby-sitter. One of these families is a
single mom with a little girl. Julia, this is her name, is a waitress in a restaurant. She is a
great person and we became close friends. So, sometimes I offer her help with her child
when she has to work in the evenings. Another family has two funny little twins. One time
their parents asked me to babysit their children because they had to attend an
unexpected presentation.
I think this kind of help brings many benefits to my community. First of all, people become
friendlier. For example, those families, which I mentioned above, became friends after I
introduced them to each other. Second of all, people get to know each other and feel
more secure in their houses and apartments. Finally, I am ready to help those people
because I am sure that they will help me too. One time I lost the keys from my car and
Julia offered me her car for a while.
To sum up, I believe that baby-sitting is a great way to help my community in many
aspects.
