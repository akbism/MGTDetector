Recently, a hostile debate arouse when a few well reputable health organizations
suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition. In this
assay, I will analyse why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our
youngsters safety, according to my vision.
Firstly , tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the later addictive
effect. Nicotin , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on
smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by scientist on animals, specailly
rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead by time to dependency, just similar to the
effect experienced with herion.
Secondly, restriction on cigerattes selling will surely show an instant decline in tobacco
smoking. ” Having an easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, specially on
teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of Pschycology department at
Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the
severity of smoking is equivilant to other lethal drugs usage woulod be a life saving
step,they will thank us for() as they get older.” he continues.
To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law as the suggested one will definetly have a
positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.
