I totally disagree with the idea of high-level employees leaving at the age of 55 to make
room for the upcoming generation. While it is true that the energy level and fresh ideas of
youth can rejuvenate a company, the steady hand of experience can still best guide a
company in most cases.
In English there is a saying, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” In the fast-paced
world of business, bolstered by even faster hi-tech innovations, a younger more pliant
mind would seem to be able to adapt with greater flexibility, while such an environment
might boggle an older more set-in-its-ways mind. Take, for example, Microsoft’s Bill
Gates, whose energy and brilliant insights as a youth helped him to pioneer new territory
in the computer software world and establish a digital empire. Now as a more mature
CEO, this king of the “computer” mountain is constantly on the verge of being knocked
down by upcoming digeratti entrepreneurs. However, it is now the experience he has
accumulated as an older man which keeps him on top. So, combining the vigour and
innovation of younger workers with the experience of older workers would seem to be the
winning hand in the world of business.
The assertion is to give opportunities to the younger generation. If everyone retires at 55,
there will be smaller pool of experience at the company. So, who will show them the ropes
of the trade? It would be as if we lopped off the last few chapters of a textbook. On this
point the argument would seem to be built on false presumptions.
And think of all the other problems retirement at 55 would create. With life expectancy in
many advanced nations at 70-plus years, how would the state along with private
enterprises be able to support their retirement pensions? The economic repercussions of
such an idea could be great.
Besides, the Western form of capitalism is built on competition and merit and not seniority
according to age, and democracy is built on equality for all regardless of one’s age, so the
argument clearly goes against these two pillars of Western society.
Granted, my counter-arguments are perhaps as simplistic as the original assertion itself,
but without qualifying the assertion with greater supporting evidence or background
information, both sides can be argued. Nevertheless, even after thoroughly considering
the argument, I believe I would still adhere to my viewpoint that the assertion lacks merit
for the aforementioned reasons. Besides, when I am 55 I do not fancy the idea of being
put out to pasture. I think I will still be full of vitality and have a desire to work, so I hope
my workplace will view me as a treasure house of valuable experience to pass along to
the next generation and keep me on until I am at least 65 if not older.
