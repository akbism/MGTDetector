It is clear to me that the idea of a single global currency is an excellent ideal to work
towards. There can be no doubt that trade and travel would be vastly easier. On the other
hand I believe that it would cause problems today.
The benefits of a single currency can be seen with the use in Europe of the Euro.
Whenever you are travelling between countries using the Euro, the problems of currency
changing and exchange rates are history. Similarly business between countries using the
Euros is so much easier; no more worrying about exchange rate risk and pricing.
Everyoneâ€›s money is the same. The same thing is true with the US dollar. Most countries
do not use the US dollar but it is accepted in many places. There are many countries that
you can travel to and just take US dollars to use.
At present though a global currency would be impossible. Firstly most countries would not
accept the idea. Secondly all countries are in different economic states. Some are
economically very strong and some are in a state of collapse with inflation ruining the
economy. Such countries could not be brought into a world currency as it would cause
massive financial instability worldwide. So it is clear that a global currency would indeed
cause some serious problems.
So, in conclusion I see a global currency as a future ideal but it will not happen in my
lifetime. It would make trade and travel much easier but the problems it would cause
nowadays would be insurmountable.
