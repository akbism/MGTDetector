It can be argued that a nation maintains its culture through its language, and so there is a
need to restrict the use of foreign words and changes in pronunciation. However, in reality
this approach is fruitless, because language is a living thing and it is impossible to stop it
from changing. This policy has been tried in some countries, but it never works. People,
especially young people, will use the language that they hear around them, and which
separates them from others; stopping the use of certain words will only make them
appear more attractive.
As for spelling, we all know that the English system is irregular and, I believe, it would
benefit from simplification so that children and other learners do not waste time learning to
read and write. On the other hand, some people may feel, perhaps rightly, that it is
important to keep the original spelling of words as a link with the past and this view is also
held by speakers of languages which do not use the Roman alphabet.
While it is important for people who speak a minority language to be able to learn and use
that language, it is practical for education to be in a common language. This creates
national pride and links people within the society. Realistically, schools are the best place
for this to start.
Ultimately, there is a role for governments to play in the area of language planning,
particularly in education, but at no time should governments impose regulations which
restrict people's linguistic freedom.
