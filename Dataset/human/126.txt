I would have to completely disagree with the statement above. In the following
paragraphs I will outline the basic concepts of my position.
First of all, I will least the major disadvantages for employers. On the today's market a
company must be very flexible in order to compete with other firms. So, imagine the
situation when a company can not fire its employees to stay on the market. It will lead to
loosing not only a profit, but the clients, market share and competitive ability. Now,
imagine the situation when a company is growing fast, everything is good and the next
few years are going to be excellent. So, employers need more people to extend the
production. However, nobody can tell what will happen in a few years. In this case,
employers will be afraid to hire new people and extend their business because they will
not be able to fire them if something goes wrong. Another important aspect of this is that a
company can not have the best employees. It can not hire the better one without
dismissing another employee.
What kind of disadvantages will have an employee in exchange for this kind of job
security? First of all, it will be very difficult to find a job if one is not the best, because an
employer does not want to spend money on one's education. Besides, employer will not
have a chance to fire one if he does not do his job well. Second of all, employees with this
kind of security tend not to perfect themselves because after they are hired they can not
lose their job.
In conclusion, I would like to add that this statement has some positive aspects too such
as constancy, a strong spirit of the company, etc. This system takes place in Japan and
some companies succeeded in it. But I think that the reason of it subsists in the Japanese
traditions, the particular cultural features, habits and customs. However, on today's
market here in the United States a company can not afford to hire employees for their
entire life.
