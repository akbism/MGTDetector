There are some conditions under which a novelist could reasonably expect some
government suport. In general terms, if the writer has already proved that he or she can
write well, and if the stories produced are stimulating and interesting, then I consider that
some financial help might be given.
Language quality is difficult to define, but if the writing shows, for example, good
grammar, a wide vocabulary, and elegance and imagination, then I can see a valid reason
for assisting an author to spend some time free from money problems. Such a writing
needs to be encouraged. the entertainment value of a book would be also a factor in
deciding whether to provide assistance to an author. Further consideration would include
social and educational values expressed in the author's work.
However, if the ideas were socially irresponsible, or if the stories contain unnecessary
violence or pornography for its own sake, then I would not want to see the author
sponsored to write stories which do not benefit society. Other exceptions are the many
writers of good books who do not require financial help. Books which proved to be
extremely popular, such as the Harry Potter stories, clearly need no subsidy at all
because the authors have become rich through their writing.
Views on what good quality writing means will vary widely, and so if any author is to be
given money for writing, then the decision would have to be made by a committee or
panel of judge. An individual opinion would certainly cause disagreement among the
reading public.
