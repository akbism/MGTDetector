Families who do not send their children to public school should be required to pay taxes
that support public education.
Every child in my country is required to attend school and every child is welcome to enroll
at his/her local public school. Some families choose to send their children to other
schools, and it is their prerogative to do so. However, the public schools are used by the
majority of our children and must remain open for everyone. For example, my uncle sent
his two children to a private academy for primary school. Then he lost a huge amount of
money through some poor investments and he could no longer afford the private school's
tuition. The children easily transferred to their local public school and liked it even more
than their academy. The public schools supported their family when they had no money to
educate their children.
Because the public schools educate so many citizens, everyone in my country-whether a
parent or not-should pay taxes to support our educational system. We all benefit from the
education that students receive in public school. Our future doctors, fire fighters, and
teacherspeople whom we rely on everyday-are educated in local public schools. When a
person is in trouble, it's reassuring to know that those who will help you-such as fire
fighters-know what they're doing because they received good training in school and later.
Providing an excellent education in the public school system is vital to the strength of our
community and our country.
Our government must offer the best education available, but it can only do so with the
financial assistance of all its citizens. Therefore, everyone-including families who do not
send their children to public school-should support public education by paying taxes.
