In most countries of the world the population is increasing alarmingly. This is especially
true in poor, undeveloped countries. Overpopulation causes a considerable number of
problems.
In poor countries it is difficult to provide enough food to feed even the present number of
people. In addition, education to limit the number of children per family is not always
successful. Poorer countries usually have a lot of unemployment too, and an increase in
population simply makes the situation worse. The environment also suffers when there
are too many people living on the land.
In rich, industrialised and developing countries it is very difficult for governments to
provide effective public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is usually a great
deal more crime, which is often due to high rates of unemployment. Further large
increases in population only cause more overcrowding, unemployment and crime.
There are two main solutions to the overpopulation problem. Firstly, every woman who is
pregnant, but who does not want to give birth, should be allowed by law to have an
abortion. Secondly, governments must educate people to limit the size of the family. In
China, couples are penalised financially if they have more than one child. This may seem
cruel, but the "one-child policy" is beginning to have an effect in the world's most populous
nation. Eventually, similar policies might also be necessary in other crowded nations such
as India, for example.
To sum up, if the population explosion continues, many more people will die of starvation
in poor countries, and life in the cities, even in affluent nations, will become increasingly
difficult.
