In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to
the utilization of computers at nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to
complicated surgery performing. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of
difficult tasks but is this excessive dependance ripping the warmth of our lives? In this
essay, I will outline how the availability of computers affects our lives.
Most of the daily tasks an individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These
two fundemental qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The
average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an
hour to and hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally
reduced to half if computerized decivesare used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman
is enabled to easily close a profitable deal just with a touch on this highly programmed
laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling
long distances just to sign a deal.
On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern
utilities, which make them handicapped when it comes to preparing a cup of tea.
Inaddition, psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for sucidal rate increase is
recent electric inventions. This is due to that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy
through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a
financially satisfying standard of life they gradually isulate themselves. As time passes by
each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads
to suicidal attempts specially among youngsters.
In conclusion, similar to every other invention computers has its benefits and drawbacks, I
personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key
here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.
