Different countries have different education systems. I donâ€›t know all the education
systems in the world but all the ones I do know about have free school education at
primary and secondary level. I certainly agree with the statement that this should be the
case. I believe university education is different.
No matter what standard of income someone has or what society someone comes from,
everyone should have the opportunity to have a good standard of education. This is not
always what happens but it is what should happen. Private schools can be available for
those who want and can afford it but the free schools should always be there. This is
certainly one of the best attributes of western democracy and all countries it seems strive
to attain situation although some have problems due to the economic and political
situations in their countries. Governments should make sure that all their citizens have
access to a good standard of free education at primary and secondary level.
Further education is different. In an ideal world this should be free but governments have
a lot of demands on their money. I think that students should have to pay, maybe not all,
but at least a contribution towards their tuition fees. They will be able to earn it back once
they have graduated. The UK has this system whereas in the US students have to pay all
their high tuition fees which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars over a full
course. I am not sure if I agree with this but it certainly would make sure that students
make the best of efforts to pass or all their money would be wasted.
Therefore I conclude that primary and secondary education should be freely available for
all if possible but that further education should not necessarily be wholly free.
