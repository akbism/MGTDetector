Reducing the wealth gap can be achieved by cancelling third world debt, cancelling trade
and farming subsidies so that third world countries can compete, getting rid of third world
corruption and investing and building in third world countries using local people and skills
and allowing them ownership of businesses. There are other things as well. Unfortunately
there is no profit in business for first world countries to do these things. Some will do them
but most will not. The ordinary man on the street wants things to be better for poorer
countries and the politicians say that they will help but the politicians will in the end do
what business tells them to do. Politicians also rightly feel they have a duty to protect their
own countries and keeping economically dominant is part of this duty. Creating effective
competition for their own countryâ€›s businesses is not part of what they are expected to do.
This then leads on to whether I believe that developed countries have a duty to help the
developing countries. Yes, I do. As an individual I believe that we have a duty to assist the
poorer countries with their development in all aspects. We can provide teachers and
education and doctors on the small scale and on the larger scale the things that I have
talked about in the previous paragraph. Can we do this? Yes. Will we do this? See the
previous paragraph again.
In conclusion you can see that I believe that there is a split between what would happen
in a perfect world and what actually happens. We have a duty to reduce the wealth gap
between developed and developing countries and we can do it, but it is unlikely that this
will happen quickly.
