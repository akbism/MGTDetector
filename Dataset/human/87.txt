In our modern stressful world we often forget about our customs and traditions. However,
I think that people should keep their traditions because they help to remember our
forefathers and value the beautiful moments we have in our lives.
In my country we have a great custom called "Maslenica". It is a holiday, which is
celebrated at the end of the winter. Many people gather on the biggest square of the city
and see of the winter. They say to the winter good-bye and ask the spring to change the
winter. They celebrate the beginning of the life when everything starts to grow.
People at this holiday bake pancakes and treat each other with them. Also, many people
gathered on the square play different games. For example, the most well-known game
"pulling a rope" subsists in that two teams pull a rope. The winner is the team, witch has a
longer rope. Other people draw on the icy pole. People have fun at this holiday even if
they just observe those games and do not participate.
In conclusion, I am sure that "Maslenica" would benefit many countries all over the world.
People have the opportunity to relax, leave their troubles and worries behind and have
fun. Also, this holiday helps people to find out more about each other, communicate and
meet new people. In addition to those practical benefits, "Maslenica" helps people to slow
down their life pace and enjoy the present moments that are irreplaceable and
beautiful.
