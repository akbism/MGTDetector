Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago
and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday
life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short
time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on
computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You
have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the
chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated
computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no
individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but
they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be
able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in
the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go
wrong. If one small program fails disaster.
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly
complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to
control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is
controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be
suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never
become totally dependent on a completely technological world.
