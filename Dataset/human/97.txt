Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from
treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Of course it goes without saying that prevention is better than cure. That is why, in recent
years, there has been a growing body of opinion in favour of putting more resources into
health education and preventive measures. The argument is that ignorance of, for
example, basic hygiene or the dangers of an unhealthy diet or lifestyle needs to be
combatted by special nationwide publicity campaigns, as well as longer-term health
education.
Obviously,there is a strong human argument for catching any medical condition as early
as possible. There is also an economic argument for doing so. Statistics demonstrate the
cost-effectiveness of treating a condition in the early stages, rather than delaying until
more expensive and prolonged treatment is necessary. Then there are social or economic
costs, perhaps in terms of loss of earnings for the family concerned or unemployed
benefit paid by the state.
So far so good, but the difficulties start when we try to define what the 'proportion' of the
budget should be, particularly if the funds will be 'diverted from treatment'. Decisions on
exactly how much of the total health budget should be spent in this way are not a matter
for the non-specialist, but should be made on the basis of an accepted health service
model.
This is the point at which real problems occur - the formulation of the model. How do we
accurately measure which health education campaigns are effective in both medical and
financial terms? How do we agree about the medical efficacy of various screening
programmes, for example, when the medical establishment itself does not agree? A very
rigorous process of evaluation is called for, so that we can make informed decisions.
