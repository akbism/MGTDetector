Parents shape their children from the beginning of their children's lives. They teach their
children values. They share their interests with them. They develop close emotional ties
with them. Parents can be very important teachers in their children's lives; however, they
are not always the best teachers.
Parents may be too close to their children emotionally. For example, they may limit a
child's freedom in the name of safety. A teacher may organize an educational trip to a big
city, but a parent may think this trip is too dangerous. A school may want to take the
children camping, but a parent may be afraid of the child getting hurt.
Another problem is that parents sometimes expect their children's interests to be similar to
their own. If the parents love science, they may try to force their child to love science too.
But what if the child prefers art? If the parents enjoy sports, they may expect their child to
participate on different teams. But what if the child prefers to read?
Parents want to pass on their values to their children. However, things change. The
children of today are growing up in a world different from their parents' world. Sometimes
parents, especially older ones, can't keep up with rapid social or technological changes. A
student who has friends of different races at school may find that his parents have
narrower views. A student who loves computers may find that her parents don't
understand or value the digital revolution.
Parents are important teachers in our lives, but they aren't always the best teachers.
Fortunately, we have many teachers in our lives. Our parents teach us, our teachers
teach us, and we learn from our peers. Books and newspapers also teach us. All of them
are valuable.
