I think it is a great idea to build a new university in my community. However, I think it is a
controversial question whether the building of a new university will bring only benefits to
our community. In this essay I will analyze advantages and disadvantages of this issue
and present my view in favor of establishing a new university in my community.
From the one side, establishing a new university in my community brings many benefits.
First of all, a new construction means more job opportunities. I think it would be good for
my community because many people have to spend much time driving to their work day
in and day out because they could not find a job in our neighborhood. Second of all, a
new university is a good chance to meet new people and I like this opportunity. Many
students will live in our community. Finally, if a new university is built in my community
there is a big chance that I will be willing to enroll in it. I think it is great because it is not
far from my place and I do not have to move to another part of the city. Another important
aspect of this is that people from my community will have a chance to use new libraries
and facilities of a new university. For example some people can take courses and classes
there.
From the other side, building a new university can bring some disadvantages. A new
construction means noise, traffic jams and different kinds of pollution. In addition to these
disadvantages, many young people in our community can cause more noise especially in
the evenings.
To sum up, I think that I would support the decision of the government of establishing a
new university in my community despite a few disadvantages that could follow this
construction. I believe that a new university will increase a chance of many young people
to get a higher education, gain more knowledge and experience, which will help them to
succeed in todayâ€™s world.
