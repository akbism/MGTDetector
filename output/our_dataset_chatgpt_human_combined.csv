0,0,"There is continuous debate over preserving past historical buildings. Some prefer modern architecture and designs and bat for cheaper new buildings instead of preserving old ones. I personally disagree with this view and will further prove my point in this essay.
Some were spared the destruction and some remain as painful reminders of the regime. Historical buildings have a rich and vast history to be talked about. By visiting century old buildings or sites, people witness city’s diverse culture and complexity and this is the reason why people are attracted to historic places and buildings. Thereby attracting foreign currency and generate work for local people. It promotes growth and add value to the economy.
The historical buildings were made with high-quality construction material and by the most talented engineers of that era. For example, the temple Abu Simbel located in southern Egypt carved out of a sandstone rock cliff is a marvel piece of complex engineering. Their huge external rock relief figures have become iconic. The temple is one of the most popular tourist sites in Egypt. Such practices and materials are not really seen in modern era buildings and many historic buildings are much better than its brand new counterpart.The government can avoid costly new constructions by simply upgrading the historic buildings with relatively inexpensive modifications and converting them to hotels, coffee shops or a tourist place. Also, the government should encourage public sector undertakings and corporate houses to conserve, restore and maintainprotected buildings and sites.
To conclude, the preservation and conservation of historical buildings are in the long term interest of society.

1,10001,"There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people's lives,
especially in the field of education. Nowadays, an increasing number of students rely on
computers to research for information and to produce a perfect paper for school
purposes. Others have decided to leave the original way of learning to get knowledge
through online schools. These changes in the learning process have brought a special
concern regarding the possible decrease of importance of teachers in the classroom.
Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been
helping some students to progress in their studies quicker than when compared with an
original classroom. For example, in the same classroom, students have different
intellectual capacities, thus some would be tied to a slow advance in their studies
because of others’ incapacity of understanding. In this way, pupils could progress in their
acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using computers instead of learning from
teachers.
However, the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact
influences them in positive ways. Firstly, students realize that they are not dealing with a
machine but with a human being who deserves attention and respect. They also learn the
importance of studying in group and respect other students, which helps them to improve
their social skills.
Moreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some
student's deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same
explanation, giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor. Hence, students
can have a bigger chance not to fail in a subject.
In conclusion, the role for teachers in the learning process is still very important and it will
continue to be in the future because no machine can replace the human interaction and
its consequences.",human
2,10002,"Nobody can argue that the acquisition of knowledge is more fun and easier with
computers. The mere activity of touching and exploring this device constitutes an
enjoyable task for a kid. This, accompanied with the relaxing attitude and software
interactivity, usually conduce to a better grasping of new knowledge. At a higher
educational level; the availability of digital books, simulator and other academic materials,
provide the student with an ever accessible source of information, that otherwise would
not be at hand.
But, besides the increasing complexity and behavior of intelligent software, which is
usually embedded in the academic digital material, the need of human interaction in the
learning process will always be present, at least in the foreseeable future. There is the
necessity for a human being to be able to determine what the specifics needs of each
individual are. The expertise of a teacher in how to explain and adapt complex concepts
to different individuals can hardly be mimicked by a computer, no matter how
sophisticated its software is.
As computers are becoming a common tool for teaching, teachers should be more aware
of their role as guides in the acquisition of knowledge rather than transmitters of facts.
They have to be open minded to the changes that are taking places, keep updated and
serve as a problem solvers in the learning process, thus allowing students to discover the
fact for themselves.
To summarize, in my personal view, teachers play and will play an important role in the
classroom, especially at the primary level. No matter how complex computers become,
there will be no replacement for the human interaction, but in the way haw this interaction
takes place.",human
3,2,"It is quite common these days for young people in many countries to have a break from
studying after graduating from high school. This trend is not restricted to rich students
who have the money to travel, but is also evident among poorer students who choose to
work and become economically independent for a period of time.
The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that a young adult who passes
directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and
experience of the world. By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or
traveling to other places have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw
on. They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study
and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges
of student life.
However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at that important age. Young adults
may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an academic
environment. They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do
something completely different from a university course. But overall, I think this is less
likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career.
My view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the
best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives
and why. Students with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated
ones and taking a year off may be the best way to gain this.",human
4,3,"People learn through their entire lives. They constantly improve their knowledge and
develop. I think that a college or university education should be available to all students
because every person has the right to choose the way to self-perfection. Bellow I will give
some of my reasons to support my position.
First of all, every person should have the chance to get a higher degree, gain new
knowledge and experience. However, some people believe that higher education should
be available only to good students. I think it is silly. It is like to make unavailable traveling
for one who does not have IQ high enough.
Second of all, some young people do not do well at school but they have great personality
and ability to learn. They are self-confident, persistent and patient. With these qualities
they can get higher grades then their classmates who are talented but lazy. Imagine for
example situation when a teenager gets high grades because his or her parents
constantly make him or her study and help to do most of the homework. In this case a
child does very well at school but I think a college can show the opposite results.
Finally, it is a discrimination against students to make available higher education only for
good ones.
So, if a student does poor and gets low grades he/she should be sent down. But if a
person was never given a chance to try himself/herself at college, what to do in this case?
To sum up, I think that all young people should have the chance to get a higher
education. To take or not this chance must be up to them.",human
5,4,"From my everyday experience and observation I can stand that the best way of learning
about life is through personal experience. However, some people think that it is wiser to
learn about life through listening to the advice of family and friends. It does not mean I
totally disagree with this way of learning. Moreover, I think that it is wise for a person to
take an intermediate position because each of these ways has its own advantages.
Bellow I will give my reasons to support my point of view.
From the one side, learning through one's personal experience brings many benefits. First
of all, scientists say that personal experience has greater impact on a person. I have to
agree with this. Take for example children. They will not believe their parents that
something can hurt them until they try it and make sure in it. Furthermore, most likely they
will remember this experience longer. Second of all, people learn how to analyze their
mistakes, make conclusions and next time try to avoid them. So, I think it is a great
experience that makes people stronger, more self-confident and persistent. They gain
more knowledge and experience that will be very helpful and valuable in the future.
From the other side, listening to the advice of family and friends brings many benefits too.
Parents with great patience pass down their knowledge and experience to their children.
They teach them all they know and they want their children do not make the same
mistakes. In addition to those practical benefits, learning from someone's advice is
painless. For example, parents nowadays very often talk to their children about drugs. I
think it is a great example when one should not try drugs in order to gain new experience.
I think it is a case when children must trust their parents.
To sum up, I think it is wise to combine both of these ways to learn and try to analyze
personal mistakes as well as not personal. I think together they can greatly simplify one's
life and make the way to success shorter.",human
6,5,"What young people should study at school has long been the subject of intense debate
and this is a question that certainly does not have one correct answer.
We need to provide young people the best possible chance of doing well at school. In
traditional curriculum there is a wide variety of subjects with a mix of academic and nonacademic subjects. In this way a young person is formed with a rounded education. Nonacademic subjects would include sports, cooking, woodwork and metalwork. I believe this
is the best form of education. A young person should learn things other than academic
subjects. Sport is particularly important. Young people have to learn to love sport so that
they can be fit and healthy later in life. If not we will be raising an obese and unfit
generation.
I totally understand the point of view that education is so important that students must be
pushed as hard as possible to achieve their best. It sounds a good idea to only expose
the students to academic subjects as then they can spend all of their school hours on
studying areas that will get them into university and good jobs later in life. I just feel a
more rounded education would produce a better individual. We must remember too that a
lot of people, maybe even most people, aren‛t academically minded and would benefit
more from a more vocationally based education. Forcing academic studies onto them
would lead to failure and the student leaving school too early.
Therefore I agree that although a wholly academic curriculum would suit and benefit some
young people, I believe that for most students non-academic subjects are important
inclusions still in today‛s syllabuses.",human
7,6,"Over the past few decades, academic subjects have become increasingly important in
this fast-changing information-based society. Nowadays, there has been a growing
debate as to whether it would be more effective to replace physical education classes with
academic subjects. Despite the importance of sports, I highly believe that it is inevitable
and more efficient to focus more on academic subjects for several reasons.
Those who argue that sports and exercise classes are needed in school base their case
on the following arguments. First of all, sports are a good way to build character and
develop personality. That is, there are necessary for learning about competition,
cooperation, and good sportsmanship. In addition, as a majority of children these days
are addicted to the Internet, they find it hard to leave their computer. Consequently, a
growing number of children are becoming overweight or obese due to a lack of exercise.
So, if schools foster an environment that deprives students of getting a proper physical
education, it will have a long-term negative effect on children both mentally and
physically.
Nevertheless, people should not ignore the fact that devoting more time and energy to
academic subjects will benefit students more in the long run. The time devoted to physical
education now would be better spent teaching students English. This is because speaking
fluent English will give young people an advantage over other college applicants and job
seekers in the near future. Besides, science will undoubtedly benefit youth more than
physical education as well. The principles learned in science will provide the necessary
foundation for solving and difficult problems that are sure to arise in students' futures.
In summary, there are high hopes that educators and parents exercise wisdom in
teaching young generations.",human
8,7,"High school students face many decisions as they prepare to graduate, including what
they are going to do after graduation. Some high school students go directly to college or
university after graduation. Others prefer to travel or work for some time before going to
university.
For those who choose to go college or university after graduation, there are advantages
and disadvantages. One of the big advantages of going directly from high school to
college is that you are still in the habit of studying. By going to college after graduation,
you do not lose the study skills that you developed during high school. The big
disadvantages, however, is that you may not be ready for college. You may not know
exactly what you want to study, or you may be more interested in freedom and parties
than in your courses. At that age, it is often difficult for students to take on the
responsibilities of college.
There are also advantages and disadvantages to working or traveling befor starting
college. Working or traveling allows you a better idea of what you want to do with your life.
You gain practical experience that helps you define what you want to study. You also are
well prepared for the responsibilities of college or university studies. On the other hand,
by the time you start college, you will probably have obligations, like a job or spouse,
which keep you from focusing on studies. In addition, travelling or working before college
may cause you to spend enough time out of school that you forget how to study.
The desicion of what to do after hich school graduation can be a difficult one. Deciding
whether to go straight into college or university or take time to work or travel is something
that faces every high school student. After thinking about the advantages and
disadvantages of both options, the decision should be based on what is best for you.",human
9,8,"Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is
not enough. Therefore, the student who study from the school to university get benefit
less and contribute less too, than those of student who go to travel or job and get
experience and skills before going high. There are two following reasons to prove for my
opinion. I call the group of people who study from school to university is group A and the
other group is group B.
Firstly, at school and university, what group A gain is almost theory, theory and theory. Of
course, theory is very neccessary, however, you can’t do everything with theory. You
must have praticeable experience. This is what group A lack very much. Although in the
third of forth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help
them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of short time. And the
real job is still very strange with them. After graduating, without experience, group A can’t
accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it take them time and money to keep
up with other experienced ones and may be scorned. Therefore, group A can contribute
less than group B who have the most two important things: skills and experience.
Secondly, as group A is contribute less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many
companies which employ people in group A have to train them from the back-ground.
These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to get rid of the fact that their
employees may leave after being trained to other companies. So, less benefit is
unavoidable and certain, Whereas group B are more loyal and effective workers. They
also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even
higher than group A. As the result, group B get more benefit absolutely.
In conclusion, I think student should go to travel or job before going high. Therefore, they
can’t only have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them
to get a good job and a brilliant future.",human
10,9,"There is no doubt that some students in schools behave badly and their behaviour causes
difficulty for others either because it has a negative effect on the group or because
ordinary students find it difficult to study with them.
One solution is to take these students away and teach them on their own. However, if we
simply have them removed after one or two warnings, we are limiting their educational
opportunities because it seems to me that a school which caters for difficult students is a
sort of ""prison"" whatever name you give it and the people who go there may never
recover from the experience. This can then cause problems for the wider society.
Perhaps we need to look at why the disruptive students behave badly before we separate
them. Disruptive students may be very intelligent and find the classes boring because the
work is too easy. Perhaps these students need extra lessons rather than separate
lessons. Or perhaps the teachers are uninspiring and this results in behavioural problems
so we need better teachers. On the other hand, most students put up with this situation
rather than cause trouble, and some people argue that we have to learn to suffer bad
teachers and boring situations and that students who can't learn this lesson need to be
taught separately.
So before we condemn the students to a special school, we should look at factors such as
the teaching, because once the children have been separated, it is very unlikely that they
will be brought back.",human
11,10,"In the past, a majority of academics have held the opinion that universities should only
offer a theoretically-based approach to teaching throughout their courses, as opposed to
the more recent trend towards empirical acquisition of knowledge involving more “hands
on” experience. Is this the most effective way for students to learn vital academic
information while undertaking their degrees? Undoubtedly, advantages and
disadvantages of both academic learning styles have to be evaluated.
Firstly, on the one hand, despite being the more traditional educational approach, learning
from theory in relevant academic discourses to identify established knowledge allows us
to gain a professional insight. For example, students can easily identify facts and opinions
from past discourses. In addition, students acquire knowledge more easily when given
relative theoretical examples to build upon. For instance, in subjects such as history or
sociology, studying textbook examples allows students to unravel complex academic
theories which they could expand on. Alternatively, there are some disadvantages for
students.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that students could find themselves reading tedious
and monotonous academic papers. For instance, university degrees involving the
evaluation of numerous ‘long-winded’ academic discourses provide little inspiration for
students, discouraging enthusiasm. Obviously, interest can be stimulated through
empirical research in class. By this I mean that ‘the human brain learns best by doing’.
Although time-consuming, there is no substitute for learning from making mistakes.
In conclusion, while both approaches have benefits and drawbacks in our ever-changing
academic world, I honestly believe that a more practical approach promotes a stronger
acquisition of academic knowledge. In spite of the comprehensive nature which
theoretical teaching can possibly provide, practical learning equals more positive learning
for future generations.",human
12,11001,"People attend college for a lot of different reasons. I believe that the three most common
reasons are to prepare for a career, to have new experiences, and to increase their
knowledge of themselves and of the world around them.
Career preparation is probably the primary reason that people attend college. These
days, the job market is very competitive. Careers such as information technology will
need many new workers in the near future. At college, students can learn new skills for
these careers and increase their opportunities for the future.
Students also go to college to have new experiences. For many, it is their first time away
from home. At college, they can meet new people from many different places. They can
see what life is like in a different city. They can learn to live on their own and take care of
themselves without having their family always nearby.
At college, students have the opportunity to increase their knowledge. As they decide
what they want to study, pursue their studies, and interact with their classmates, they
learn a lot about themselves. They also, of course, have the opportunity to learn about
many subjects in their classes. In addition to the skills and knowledge related to their
career, college students also have the chance to take classes in other areas. For many,
this will be their last chance to study different subjects.
Colleges offer much more than career preparation. They offer the opportunity to have new
experiences and to learn many kinds of things. I think all of these are reasons why people
attend college.",human
13,11002,"People attend colleges or universities for a lot of different reasons. I believe that the three
most common reasons are to prepare for a career, to have new experiences, and to
increase their knowledge of themselves and the world around them.
Career preparation is becoming more and more important to young people. For many, this
is the primary reason to go to college. They know that the job market is competitive. At
college, they can learn new skill for careers with a lot of opportunities. This means
careers, such as information technology, that are expected to need a large workforce in
the coming years.
Also, students go to colleges and universities to have new experiences. This often means
having the opportunity to meet people different from those in their hometowns. For most
students, going to college is the first time they’ve been away from home by themselves. In
additions, this is the first time they’ve had to make decisions on their own. Making these
decisions increases their knowledge of themselves.
Besides looking for self-knowledge, people also attend a university or college to expand
their knowledge in subjects they find interesting. For many, this will be their last chance
for a long time to learn about something that doesn’t relate to their career.
I would recommend that people not be so focused on a career. They should go to college
to have new experiences and learn about themselves and the world they live in.",human
14,12,"I strongly believe that the pros far outweigh the cons, and will examine both below.
One of the greatest advantages is that the children learn to be independent. Having to
cook, clean, and pay bills instills this in them. Often they have to work part-time to make
ends meet, and this impresses upon them the importance of work and money
management.
Another important factor is that these children will be exposed to different cultures and
ways of thinking. They will become more open-minded and tolerant and are likely to
become more adaptable individuals.
One of the main motives for sending young people abroad to study is that it enhances
their employment prospects. In my experience of living in foreign countries and speaking
to various youths, it seems that a foreign education is regarded as something desirable
and helpful in getting a decent job. A degree from Britain, for example, is seen as being of
a higher standard than one from a developing country. Furthermore, living in a foreign
country may lead to fluency in a second language, which is another selling point for
prospective employers. In addition, many companies are keen to recruit people with a
global outlook.
There are a few drawbacks however. For instance, without parental supervision, the new
found freedom children experience may lead to harmful practices such as drug-taking and
drinking. Reluctance or inability to reintegrate into their mother country is another. To sum
up, it can be seen that the advantages of studying abroad for children are more numerous
than the disadvantages. Of course a lot depends on the age of the child, but I believe that
for most teenagers it would be a positive experience.",human
15,13001,"In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
""Experience is the best teacher"" is an old cliché, but I agree with it. We can learn a lot of
important things from books, but the most important lessons in life come from our own
experiences. Throughout the different stages of life, from primary school to university to
adulthood, experience teaches us many skills we need for life.
As children in primary school, we learn facts and information from books, but that is not all
we learn in school. On the playground we learn how to make friends. In our class work,
we learn how it feels to succeed and what we do when we fail. We start to learn about the
things we like to do and the things we don't. We don't learn these things from books, but
from our experiences with our friends and classmates.
In our university classes, we learn a lot of information and skills we will need for our future
careers, but we also learn a lot that is not in our textbooks. In our daily lives both in class
and out of class, we learn to make decisions for ourselves. We learn to take on
responsibilities. We learn to get along with our classmates, our roommates, and our
workmates. Our successes and failures help us develop skills we will need in our adult
lives. They are skills that no book can teach us.
Throughout our adulthood, experience remains a constant teacher. We may continue to
read or take classes for professional development. However, our experiences at work, at
home, and with our friends teach us more. The triumphs and disasters of our lives teach
us how to improve our careers and also how to improve our relationships and how to be
the person each one of us wants to be.
Books teach us a lot, but there is a limit to what they teach. They can give us information
or show us another person's experiences. These are valuable things, but the lessons we
learn from our own experiences, from childhood through adulthood, are the most
important ones we learn.",human
16,13002,"People are learning and practicing through their entire life. I believe that life experience
and practice are the basic reasons of the humankind's evolution. However, in my opinion,
knowledge gained from books plays a very important role in the modern life.
The most obviously important advantage of books is that they hold all knowledge gained
by previous generations. People write books about their discoveries and inventions, which
are gained through practice and experience. This knowledge is accumulated in books that
are passed from generation to generation. So, basically, people get all knowledge about
the previous achievements from books, analyze it and than, according to their experience
and new data, write new books. In this case, books are the holders of humankind's
experience.
For example, at old times people thought that the Earth was flat. It was concluded from
observations and studdying. However, the next generations, using the experience of their
ancestors, proved that the Earth was round.
Personally, I think that books are very important because they are able to give people the
basic and fundamental knowledge. Books store history, the important events and
discoveries. Without them it is difficult and sometimes impossible to move forward, make
new discoveries and inventions.
To summarize, I think a person should take basic knowledge from books because it will
help him to make his own inventions, conclusions and discoveries. Only using both books
and one’s experience one can move forward.",human
17,14,"Some people think that fiction books have no use at all. They claim that people should
read about real events that took place, real people, and established facts. I have to totally
disagree with this statement. From my everyday experience and observation I can stand
that fiction, miracles and fairy tails are required in our life. For several reasons, which I will
mention below, I believe that fiction books play an essential role in our life.
First of all, it is kind of difficult to imagine a six year old child reading about politics or
history with the real facts that are not always pleasant. I think that children need miracles
and Santa Claus because the real world is too complicated for them. They are too
innocent and inexperienced to know the real facts and understand what a real life is
about. In addition, I am sure that making a child read only non-fiction books can result in
shock.
Second of all, following this statement about refusing from reading books about fiction
events we also should refuse from festivals, parades, and celebration such holidays as
Halloween because most of the characters there are fictional. Moreover, comic books will
disappear as well as animated films and fiction movies. The disadvantage of non-fiction
lies in the facts that nothing happens to excite the mind and spirit. From the other side,
fiction provides a great slope for a mind to think creatively.
In conclusion, I think that people need miracles. We can not be satisfied with only naked
truth. Human kind must believe in something and this belief helps people break limits and
make new inventions.",human
18,15,"There is no doubt that going to study in a foreign country, with its different language and
culture, can be a frustrating and sometimes painful experience. But while overseas study
has its drawbacks, the difficulties are far outweighed by the advantages. Indeed, people
who go abroad for study open themselves up to experiences that those who stay at home
will never have.
The most obvious advantage to overseas university study is real-life use of a different
language. While a person can study a foreign language in his or her own country, it
cannot compare with constant use of the language in academic and everyday life. There
is no better opportunity to improve second-language skills than living in the country in
which it is spoken. Moreover, having used the language during one's studies offers a
distinct advantage when one is applying for jobs back home that require the language.
On a university campus, the foreign student is not alone in having come from far away.
He or she will likely encounter many others from overseas and it is possible to make
friends from all around the world. This is not only exciting on a social level, but could lead
to important overseas contacts in later professional life.
Finally, living and studying abroad offers one a new and different perspective of the world
and, perhaps most important, of one's own country. Once beyond the initial shock of
being in a new culture, the student slowly begins to get a meaningful understanding of the
host society. On returning home, one inevitably sees one's own country in a new, often
more appreciative, light.
In conclusion, while any anxiety about going overseas for university study is certainly
understandable, it is important to remember that the benefits offered by the experience
make it well worthwhile.",human
19,16,"Today, although most students in the UAE complete school, a large number still drop out
because of family, social and work pressures. This problem requires serious action from
both individuals and the government.
Most students who do not complete school do so because of family problems. Girls,
especially, want to get married and start a family. Some parents are not interested in
education and do not support their children in studying. Social problems are also a
contributing factor. Education is compulsory but, despite this, some people do not take it
seriously. Furthermore, jobs are available even if students do not have a good education.
The third reason is work pressure. Some families are poor and need their children to work
in order to increase the income. All these problems will create young people who do not
have any skills and who will not be able to improve their lives for the family and the
country.
There are several things that can be done about these problems. Parents should be
encouraged to send their children to school. Schools with baby-minding facilities should
be opened specially for married students. The government needs to stress the importance
of education and even offer financial support to students to continue. This will encourage
students to stay at school rather than start working.
In conclusion, there are several things that the government can do to allow more people
to finish school. However, a number of society attitudes also have to change if the
country’s young people are to achieve their full potential.",human
20,17,"It is very difficult to answer the claim that a person needs a university education to be
successful in life because success in life means different things to different people. This
essay starts by defining three different ideas of success. Following this, it looks at which
types of success are dependent on a university education.
Success in life can be achieved in different ways. Many magazines and television
programmes tell us that success means having a lot of money, having a fulfilling career,
and being powerful. In contrast, most religious and spiritual organizations claim that
success means finding spiritual happiness and being at peace with God and with yourself.
Another idea of success focuses on relationships - being surrounded by people who love
you and care about you, spending time with family and friends.
A university education can help you achieve some types of success, but it makes little or
no difference to whether or not you are successful in other areas of life. Undoubtedly, a
university education is essential if you want to have a career in a profession such as law,
engineering, teaching, or medicine. However, you do not need a university degree to
become a wealthy and powerful movie star, sports star or businessperson. In fact, a
university education does not generally enable you to achieve spiritual happiness, or to
have successful relationships with family and friends.
sIn conclusion, there are many different types of success. A university education may
help you to achieve professional success in some careers. However, it will not help you to
achieve success in other areas of your life such as your spiritual life or your relationships.",human
21,18,"Today, it seems to be universally accepted that increased education is a good thing.
Thousands of colleges and millions of students spend vast amounts of time and money
chasing pieces of paper. But what is the value of these qualifications? This essay will
discuss whether education has been devalued.
Supporters of education (usually teachers or educators, or those who have an interest in
stopping people thinking for themselves) say that increased levels of education will open
doors for students. Certificates, diplomas, and degrees are held up as a status symbol, a
passport to a private club of money and power.
However, the truly powerful are not those who have taken degrees, but people who have
stood back and looked at what is really important in life. They have seen opportunity and
followed dreams. These people are found in every part of society. Like many brilliant
people, Einstein was a weak student at math. Like many successful businessmen, Bill
Gates never completed college. Like many inventive and creative people, Edison never
went to school. The greatest religious teachers do not have letters after their name, but
have looked into their hearts for meaning. Similarly, the world’s political leaders do not
have master’s degrees or doctorates. These are the people who shaped our century, and
they are too busy with real life to spend time in the paper chase.
Students in college are being sold an illusion. They are made to believe that selfunderstanding and society approval will come with the acquisition of a piece of paper.
Instead of thinking for themselves, and finding their own personality and strengths, they
are fitted like square pegs into round holes.
The role of education is to prepare masses of people to operate at low levels of ability in a
very limited and restricted range of activities. Some of these activities are more
challenging than perhaps the assembly lines of the past, but still the ultimate purpose is
equally uninteresting. More worryingly, despite the increased level of education, people
are still not genuinely expected to think for themselves. In fact, the longer years of
schooling make the job of brainwashing even easier.
There is still a role for study, research, and education. However, we need to examine our
emphasis on education for the sake of a piece of paper, and to learn the real meaning 
and revolutionary challenge of knowledge.",human
22,19,"In the past, degrees were very unusual in my family. I remember the day my uncle
graduated. We had a huge party, and for many years my mother called him ""the genius""
and listened to his opinion. Today, in comparison five of my brothers and sisters have
degrees, and two are studying for their masters'. However, some people think that this
increased access to education is devaluing degrees. In this essay, I will look at some of
the arguments for and against the increased emphasis on degrees in our society.
People have several arguments against the need for degrees. They say that having so
many graduates devalues a degree. People lose respect for the degree holder. It is also
claimed that education has become a rat race. Graduates have to compete for jobs even
after years of studying. Another point is that studying for such a long time leads to
learners becoming inflexible. They know a lot about one narrow subject, but are unable to
apply their skills. Employers prefer more flexible and adaptable workers.
However, I feel strongly that this move to having more qualifications is a positive
development. In the past education was only for the rich and powerful. Now it is available
to everyone, and this will have many advantages for the country and the individual. First
of all, it is impossible to be overeducated. The more people are educated, the better the
world will be, because people will be able to discuss and exchange ideas. A further point
is that people with degrees have many more opportunities. They can take a wider variety
of jobs and do what they enjoy doing, instead of being forced to take a job they dislike.
Finally, a highly educated workforce is good for the economy of the country. It attracts
foreign investment.
In conclusion, although there are undoubtedly some problems with increased levels of
education, I feel strongly that the country can only progress if all its people are educated
to the maximum of their ability.",human
23,20,"A criticism often heard these days is that the subjects taught in schools tend to be too
academic, and contribute little to preparing a young person for the real-life tasks he or she
will have to perform after graduation. They say that academic subjects are rooted in the
past, and are not useful for solving modern problems. I disagree with this point of view for
three reasons.
My first reason is that it is the duty of parents, not teachers, to prepare their children to
deal with the practical affairs of life. The home, not the classroom, is the ideal place to
learn about home management and interpersonal skills. As for work abilities and attitudes,
they are best learned “on the job” and under the supervision of an experienced older
worker.
My second reason is that academic subjects have withstood the test of time. They
represent the accumulated wisdom of our ancestors down through the ages, and, far from
being impractical, they equip us with the knowledge and confidence to make sound
judgements about any problems which may crop up. In addition, academic subjects are
good for training us in mental discipline, while practical subjects are weak in this regard.
My third reason is based on the saying “Man does not live by bread alone.” Schooldays
devoted solely to instruction in down-to-earth practical matters would be dull indeed!
Lessons in the best literature of the world, and the epoch-making scientific and
geographical discoveries of the past enrich our lives and make us feel that we are part of
the great family of mankind.
All in all, the teaching of academic subjects in schools is entirely appropriate. It is my
firmly held view that practical subjects have no place in the classroom. On the contrary,
the curriculum should be more academic!",human
24,21,"“Experience is the best teacher” is an old cliché, but I agree with it. The most important,
and sometimes the hardest, lessons we learn in life come from our participation in
situations. You can’ learn everything from a book.
Of course, learning from books in a formal educational setting is also valuable. It’s in
schools that we learn the information we need to function in our society. We learn how to
speak and write and understand mathematical equations. This is all information that we
need to live in our communities and earn a living.
Nevertheless, I think that the most important lessons can’t be taught; they have to be
experienced. No one can teach us how to get along with others or how to have selfrespect. As we grow from children into teenagers, no one can teach us how to deal with
peer pressure. As we leave adolescence behind and enter adult life, no one can teach us
how to fall in love and get married.
This shouldn’t stop us from looking for guidelines along the way. Teachers and parents
are valuable sources of advice when we’re young. As we enter into new stages in our
lives, the advice we receive from them is very helpful because they have already bad
similar experiences. But experiencing our own triumphs and disasters is really the only
way to learn how to deal with life.",human
25,22,"An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is
so much contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. The single individual
cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or
her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues should be treated
internationally.
Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held regarding
waste treatment, recycling, soil and water contamination. For sure joint efforts and
consolidation can only help in the mutual war towards the environmental disaster, which is
going on. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and
organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find
environment friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling
programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.
However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do
not confess that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take adequately care of
it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For
example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and
everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk
only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For
example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air condition
in the country, where it will be better to save energy and simply open the windows.
To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international
authorities also. Every single person should take care of environment and moreover we
have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.
This is a very good essay, Band 7+ candidate. The structure of essay and
sentences is correct as well as the spelling and punctuation. Good job!",human
26,23,"I think it is true that in almost every country today each household and family produces a
large amount of waste every week. Most of this rubbish comes from the packaging from
the things we buy, such as processed food. But even if we buy fresh food without
packaging, we still produce rubbish from the plastic bags used everywhere to carry
shopping home.
The reason why we have so much packaging is that we consume so much more on a
daily basis than families did in the past. Convenience is also very important in modern life,
so we buy packaging or canned food that can be transported from long distances and
stored untill we need it, first in the supermarket, and then at home.
However, I think the amount of waste produce is also a result of our tendency to use
something once and throw it away. We forget that even the cheapest plastic bag has used
up valuable resources and energy to produce. We also forget that it is a source of
pollution and difficult to dispose of.
I think, therefore, that governments need to raise this awareness in the general public.
Children can be educated about environmental issues at school, but adults need to take
action. Governments can encourage such action by putting taxes on packaging, such as
plastic bags, by providing recycling services and by thing households and shops that do
not attempt to recycle their waste.
With the political will, such measures could really reduce the amount of rubbish we
produce. Certainly nobody wants to see our resources used up and our planet poisoned
by waste.",human
27,24,"Recently scientists worried about climate change have urged governments to introduce
measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are seen as its main cause.
Simoultaneouslty, politicians and environmentalists have urged individuals to make
changes to their lifestyle. I shall argue that governments and individuals should take join
responsibility for this problem.
Firstly, industry accounts for a large proportion of the greenhouse gas emissions, and this
can only be controlled by government action. Measures could be taken to discourage
pollution, such as limiting or taxing the use of fossil fuels. Alternatively, subsidies could be
offered to industries to clean up their production processes. If these ideas were adopted, I
believe that businesses would regard pollution as a financial issue.
Secondly, only discussion between governments can ensure that solutions are
successful. The Kyoto agreement, for example, tried to reach global agreement on how to
address the problem. Without such co-operating, it seems to me that efforts to reduce fuel
consumption are unlikely to be effective.
However, national and international policies will only secceed if individuals also change
their lifestyle. For example, people could think more carefully about how they use energy
in their homes. By using less electricity, installing energy-efficient light bulbs and electrical
appliances, or investing in solar panels, individuals can make a real difference.
In addition, I think individual attitudes to transport need to change. Instead of making short
tips by car, people could choose to walk, cycle, or take a bus. Since cars are a major
source of the problem, changing our behaviour in this area would have a major impact.
In conclusion, I would maintain that only a combination of international agreement,
national policies, and changes in individual behaviour will succeed in preventing further
damage to the environment.",human
28,25,"As human's population is dramatically rising every year, people's requirements are
increasing too. We need more food, more fresh water, more places to live. As a result of
this many parts of the world are losing essential and sometimes irreplaceable resources,
such as forest, animals, or fresh water. In this essay I will focus on the threat of
disappearing many wild animals.
The reason why I think that animals should be preserved is that all living creatures on this
planet are connected with each other. So, the disappearance of only one species can
cause dramatic changes in the planet and even death of many other living creatures. For
example, the disappearance of bats will cause the huge increasing of insect population
and this will reflect on all animals and plants. Another example is that if the population of
bats increases, the population of insects will decrease significantly, and this will cause the
disappearance of many plants because insects are the main pollinators. So, I think it is
very important to preserve all species on our planet and live in harmony with our
environment.
Another important reason why I think that animals should be saved is that I, personally, do
not want my child to learn about different animals from books and not be able to see them
alive. I think it is shameful for humankind to explain our children that we are the reason
why those animals disappeared.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the issue about losing important natural resources is
topical and open for debate nowadays. I believe that together people can make a
difference. From my point of view, the first problem we should find a solution for is
human's overpopulation. As I mentioned above people's demands are growing and this
means we consume more and more natural resources. The second question, which is on
the list of most important issues, is pollution including the air pollution, water pollution, etc.",human
29,26,"Anyone who lives in a city is aware of the increasing number of cars on the road and the
kinds of problems this creates: traffic jams, air pollution and longer commuting periods. As
economies grow and access to cars spreads to increasing numbers of people, this trend
is likely to worsen. The solution, it would seem, is for governrnment to encourage the use
of public transport in urban areas, thus decreasing dependence on the car.
One way to stimulate public transport use is to make private car use more expensive and
inconvenient. The introduction of tolls along urban motorways has been successfully
employed in many cities. Other such measures are high-priced permits for parking in
urban areas and the restriction of parking to a limited number of cars. Faced with high
costs or no place to park, commuters would perhaps be more willing to abandon their cars
in favour of buses or trains.
There are also less punishing ways of spurring public transport use. The construction of
free carparks at suburban train stations has proven successful in quite a number of
countries. This allows commuters to drive part of the way, but take public transport into
the central, most congested, urban areas.
Indeed, making public transport more comfortable and convenient should work to attract
more commuters and decrease traffic congestion. Public transport that is convenient and
comfortable retains its passengers, much like any business that satisfies its customers.
The more commuters committed to taking public transport, the less congestion on city
streets.",human
30,27,"Over the past few decades, the increasing amount of industrial wastes and household
garbage has become a major problem in many countries. People have questioned what
caused this problem and what can be done to improve the situation. In my opinion, two of
the most critical causes of this waste material problem are the increased consumption
and a shortage of space for landfill.
To begin with, modern lifestyle has contributed greatly to the increasing amount of waste
and garbage we produce everyday. In other words, we have turned into a materialistic
and mass-consumption society where we use more and throw away more than ever
before. Moreover, countries are running out of space to store garbage and waste material.
In fact, securing land for waste disposal raises controversies in many countries.
To solve this intractable problem, every citizen needs to participate in producing less
garbage. For example, we can bring our own personal shopping bags instead of using
plastic bags provided by stores and shops. Besides, the government can enforce stricter
laws on companies to use biodegradable packaging or use recycled material. Indeed, this
alone can eliminate much of the waste which is sent to at land fills. Companies can also
contribute by developing new raw material which is recyclable and will ultimately lead to
less garbage. One good example of this is that tire companies develop new tires for cars
which are not made of rubber but of new biodegradable material.
As discussed above, individuals, business and the government can share the
responsibility to reduce the amount of waste material and to save the earth. I hope that in
the future our offspring will be better off with the well-preserved environment.",human

exploration . However, it is now time to question how meaningful these blasts are. This
essay aims to explain why it is questionable.
First, until all urgent and important matters in this globe have been solved, money
bumped on space exploration is of no meaning. It is not a common sense at all to invest
million dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration
purpose), while everyday thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of
outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority are even not welleducated. Those in rural areas or third-world nations do no even know how to prevent
common threatening diseases like AIDS and lung cancer.
Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration are to discover new lands,
new energy resources or to deter potential threat to globe. Nevertheless, is it effective to
do so while other alternatives are available? Lands on earth are no yet effectively used.
New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used.
Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All these ?not- yets? need money. That is
why costly space discovery programs are a waste of money.
In the nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration providing that () earlymentioned urgent and important matters have been solved. Also, purposes of space

considered before money is wasted.

reasons why it can happen.
First, some data may be unverifiable. For example, everytime they search for a data,
there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if
the data they are reading has accurate information. Some sources have even outdated
informations. Second, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one
site that sells goods using online purchases. The goods would be paid for by credit card
but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available
through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century

available in the library.
Others believe that internet is very useful and these are the justifications. First, it is hard to
get data, that is available in the net by other means. For example, if directory information
could not give me the accurate address and contact number of the place I want to visit, I
normally check that information from the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the
details of that certain company. Second, research becomes more comprehensive. For
instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of
the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily
compared and contrasted. I remember, my cousin researched the study about overweight
children a decade ago and at present. He was able to finish his research in just one day,

associated with its use. In my opinion, although it is true that nuclear weapons pose the
greatest threat to life, the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes also carries
some serious risks.
Nuclear power stations provide an important source of cheap power for many
industrialised nations and some developing countries. However, there is always the
danger of radiation leaking from these plants. Even though safety precautions are taken,
there have been numerous disasters such as the explosion of a nuclear plant in Russia
not long ago.
Nuclear technology is even used to help cure some diseases such as cancer. Radiation
can be applied to the body to burn away cancerous cells. This is, however, a dangerous
procedure, and the application of radiation is almost always painful and not always
successful.
The most worrying aspect of nuclear technology, though, is its use for military purposes.
Enough atomic bombs have already been built to completely destroy the planet, and the
real danger is that one day some country will start a war with these weapons. Too many
countries now have the technology required to make such bombs, and there is currently
much debate about how to control the situation.
In conclusion, nuclear technology certainly has positive uses, but is, nonetheless,
dangerous. However, it would have been better if it had never been used to create

36,33,"The spread of telecommuting is sure to have far-reaching effects on society. By itself,
telecommuting refers to offiice workers spending much of their time working from home
and using electronic technologies to communicate with their employers. The broader
implications of telecommuting, however, may involve changes to corporate structure,
workers' lifestyles and even urban planning.
The most obvious changes may be apparent in the `normal' offices of companies,
governments and other organisations. If even half the working week is spent
telecommuting from home, then we would initially expect many empty desks in the offiice.
As offices grow smaller, workers coming in for the day would be expected to share desks
with their absent colleagues. This, in turn, may affect the social atmosphere of an
organisation, however, as less social contact with one's colleagues could harm morale
and loyalty.
For the individual office worker, telecommuting would mean spending more time at home.
For a parent with young children, this may be a blessing. Moreover, many telecommuters
would be able to work the hours they wished: having a nap in the afternrnoon, for
example, but working some hours in the evening. One substantial benefit for all
telecommuting workers is that there will be no need to travel to work, allowing more free
time.
The structure of urban life is also likely to be affected by telecommuting. We would expect
to see fewer cars on the road during peak hours and, eventually, a smaller concentration
of offiices in cities' central business districts. In short, people will have less reason to
travel to city centres from outlying areas. As more people work and live in the same
location, shops and cultural events will likely relocate themselves out of the city centre.
In sum, telecommuting will serve not only to change the way we work but also the way we
live.",human
37,34,"Telecommuting will have major effects in the worlds of work and family life. However, its
biggest effect will be in the area of individual freedom, responsibility, and time
management.
Work and workplaces will alter dramatically. Offices may become smaller, as fewer desks
are needed. There will be greater need for high-bandwidth connections to link the office
and the home, and even homes to other homes, as other employees and supervisors also
begin working at home. Hours spent commuting, traffic jams, and fights for parking should
diminish, as workers make fewer journeys or work staggered hours.
Family life will also change. Workers, both husbands and wives, can arrange their work
around family commitments such as taking children to school, cooking, leisure activities,
etc. However, households will also have to set aside areas for work - particularly if both
spouses are telecommuting.
However, although the ideas of more time at home and less time traveling are attractive,
there are some drawbacks to telecommuting. People may feel unable to escape their
work, and may even work longer or more unsocial hours. The quality of work may suffer
because of the reduced face-to-face interaction with other employees. There may be
delays if other workers are not immediately available. Telecommuters may feel isolated or
unmotivated, or insecure about decisions. A major change will be in the way people think
about work as a place or an institution. Instead, they will focus on the task or product.
Workers may feel less loyal to a company and more inclined to change jobs or work parttime or on contract.
In conclusion, the effects are difficult to predict because they depend on the extent to
which telecommuting becomes popular. However, telecommuting could be the start of a
major societal shift, possibly as big as the Industrial Revolution which created our present
ideas of work.",human
38,35,"It has been widely noted that, with the growing use of computers and calculators both in
the classroom and in the home, the level of literacy and mathematical ability of students is
dropping. This raises serious doubts about the value of the progress of science and
technology. Here I will discuss the pros and cons of this question.
First of all, advances in science and technology have certainly brought about many
benefits for mankind. They have made our lives more comfortable and healthier. In
addition, they have eased the burden of work for most people and provided them with
more leisure opportunities, while at the same time increasing productivity dramatically.
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that technology has some negative side-effects. As
mentioned above, with computers which check spelling, grammar and calculation for
them, students have little incentive to learn how to do these things for themselves. Also,
the availability of TV programs and videos encourages an unhealthy, sedentary lifestyle.
Another aspect of this issue is that technology may be good or bad, depending on how we
use it. For instance, dynamite may be used to make road construction easier, or it may be
used to kill people. Again, nuclear reactors can supply huge amounts of cheap electricity,
but if they are carelessly handled they can cause devastating pollution.
We can conclude that the progress of science and technology has both positive and
negative effects. What we must do is to make sure that the positive ones are encouraged
and the negative ones are eliminated as far as possible. Among other things, this means
that students are warned not to let computers and calculators do all their work for them.

40,37,"Television has destroyed communication among friends and family.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
The invention of television is undoubtedly one of humankind's greatest inventions. It is a
way of communication among people of one country and different countries and nations.
People watch TV to find out about the latest news, weather, sports, etc. It is a great way
to learn new and extend one's range of interests. Scientists say that children spend the
same amount of hours in front of TV as they do in school. I think that this can be said
about many grown people too. Also, television is a great means of eliminating stress and
tension. One can relax and leave one's troubles behind lying on one's favorite sofa and
watching a comedy. However, some people believe that television has destroyed
communication among friends and family.
Personally, I do not agree with this statement. A couple centuries ago people spent their
time gambling, reading, gossiping or playing chess. I do not think that television is a
cause of destroyed communication among family members and friends. First of all, if
members of a family have common interests and they want to make each other happy
they will always find many ways to spend their time together and be close. Otherwise, if
people avoid each other and they do not have anything to share with each other they will
find television a great way to escape from this miserable existence. I believe that many
people chose family and their friends over some soap operas or a movie.
Second of all, I think that television can be a great resource of subjects to discuss. Many
people watch different educational programs to find out more about their environment,
nature, wild life animals, economic situations, etc. So, when they gather with their friends
they discuss important issues and arque with each other in looking for the truth.
My husband and I often watch the news channel to keep abreast of the latest news. After
that we always discuss some issues we concerned about. Also, we like to watch a TV
show ""the funniest animals"". We like this program because it makes us laugh. I can not
imagine how these programs can prevent our communication and be harmful to our
relations.
To summarize, I would like to add that if people want to communicate with each other
they will find a way to do it. Otherwise, if television were not existent, people would find
other escapes and reasons not to be with each other such as drugs, gambling, etc.",human

them such as stories, photographs about singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and young
fashion. It will be very silly if you try to provide teenagers with economic, politic news. On
the contrary, besiness men and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or
Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influence news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of
their customers.
The second is the hot, the attraction of news. Who will reads or watchs your news if it was
one year, one month ago even last week? The answer is nobody absolutely. In the
energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for really new news. So
that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has
already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they will lose their
customers. None of editors wants that bad future.
On television or in newspaper, we seem to become used to bad news. It is a little of
difficult for us to meet a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things occur on the
earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more customer, which
means more and more money, by bad news. Because bad news makes us curious. We
want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we
will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of
course, news editors.
I think it would be better if more good news was reported. Bad news makes us worry and
sad. Whereas good news makes us happy. How much bad news is, there should be the
same amount of good news. So, we can give something bad a lot of thought while still be
joyful with good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be
avoided. That is the best solution.
Now, we can’t live without news. Thereby, the role of news editors is very important. We
should support them. And what they have to do is try their best to provide us useful news,
both good and bad.

Overall, a very good essay ? to me it looks like Band 7 candidate.",human
43,39,"Televisual media has become a pervasive force in the lives of families around the world
today. Yet, a central question remains regarding whether watching television is harmful or
beneficial for children. An analysis of this question reveals that television programs
present three major concerns in the case of children, including depictions of violence, the
use of profane language, and the representation of poor moral role models.
Television programs that portray violence are a paramount concern for parents
nowadays. Recent research has shown that children may commit acts of violence
because they wish to emulate the behavior that they see on television. This is especially
true when violent acts are committed by well-known action “heroes.” In addition, television
programs show cartoon figures, as well as actors, committing violent acts. Using comic
situations to depict violent themes causes further problems with the way in which young
people view violence.
Television programs that contain profane or disrespectful language also worry parents
with young children. Because censorship laws have relaxed over the past few decades, it
has become very common for television programs of each and every kind to show
characters expressing impolite, rude, and insulting utterances to one another. Bearing
resemblance to the case of portrayals of violence, children unfortunately often try to
imitate these actions they watch on their television screens.
Finally, some parents are upset about the moral behavior depicted on television. As they
struggle to teach their children moral and ethical values, parents might despair about the
lack of morals and ethics represented in some of the so-called role models on television.
For instance, certain characters not only have no remorse for their immoral actions, but
also frequently go unpunished by larger society.
Because of these factors, many parents believe that television programs send their youth
the wrong kinds of messages. The emulation of this poor behavior by their children is
something they wish to avoid at all costs, and they have accordingly decided to ban
television in their households for these reasons.",human
44,40,"It has been around forty years since television was first introduced into Australian
households and people today still have mixed views on whether it has a positive or a
negative influence on the society.
Many people believe that television damages culture. It promotes the stronger cultures of
countries such as Britain and North America and weakens the cultures of less wealthy
countries. This is because the stronger, wealthier countries are able to assert their own
culture by producing more programs that are shown widely around the world. These
programs then influence people, particularly young people, in the countries where they
are shown.
Also, because television networks need to attract large audiences to secure their financial
survival, they must produce programs which are interesting to a broad range of people. In
Australia this range is very broad because we are a multicultural society and people of all
ages like to watch television. To interest all these different people, most television
programs are short in length, full of action and excitement, do not require much
intelligence or knowledge to understand, and follow universal themes common to all
cultures, such as love and crime. Television programs which concentrate on or develop
themes pertinent to one particular culture are not so successful because they interest a
smaller audience.
Nevertheless we much acknowledge that television does have some positive effects on
the cultures within a society as well. People who do not live within their own culture can,
in a limited way, access it through the multicultural station on the television. For example,
Aboriginal children who have grown up in white families, or migrants and international
students living in Australia, can watch programs from their own culture on the television.
In conclusion, I hold the view that television promotes and strengthens those cultures that
are wealthy and influential while it weakens the cultures that are already in a weakened
position.",human
45,41,"The mass media have a powerful influence in shaping our lives. We have come to depend
on them for information and entertainment, and in doing so we let them affect important
aspects of our lives.
The undeniable usefulness of the media in almost instantly providing information about
events around the world is largely taken for granted. But in our dependence on the media
we have allowed them to mould our notions and opinions of events, places and people.
Though few of us probably think about it, our conceptions of, say, our elected officials
spring from television images and newspaper stories. Most of us will never meet prime
ministers or presidents, but anyone who is regularly exposed to the media will have an
opinion of them. When it is time to cast our vote, we will make our decision based on how
the media portray the candidates. We are similarly swayed by coverage of wars. The
media, representing the values of their owners, societies and governments, tend to report
wars with a bias; which is the 'good' side and which the 'bad' is determined for us by
reporters, editors and commentators, and sure enough the public begins to form opinions
that reflect the coverage they see, hear and read in the major media.
The media are also influential in the way they facilitate the spread of culture and lifestyle.
The so-called 'global youth culture', in which one finds young people around the world
displaying a common interest in music, clothing styles and films, is an example of the
media's enormous sway in this regard. A popular figure such as Michael Jackson would
never be so well known were it not for the media's extensive reach into every society on
the globe.
Thus I would argue that the mass media's influence is certainly great. Indeed, with
technological advancements such as the Internet bringing even more forms of electronic
media to our homes and workplaces, it is likely the media's influence will grow even
stronger.",human
46,42,"Many people wonder about advertisement. Some people think that it has negative impact
in our life. However, others said it has been playing as positive effect in this world. This is
not an easy essay to be answered, but I will look at this issue.
Why advertisement has been playing a negative effect in our life ? Of Course for several
reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in every body especially women. They
will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from cosmetic roof, just to show
their beauty to men, which will leads to more offender and raped cases. Secondly, you
can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, nothing
important, rather than one of the companies try to convince you to buy one of their
products. It is a real intrusive example of advertisement. Lastly, sometimes you do not
have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement,
you will run to buy it, which will affect your budget.
On the other hand, there are some good things. Such as, it compares the prices of the
most of companies which benefit the consumer. Beside, it really opens our vision to see
more products which we do not knowit unless TV and Radio show these things. In
addition to, it cut down our daily routine to see new faces and know more language with
daily update for their method of advertisement.
In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this essay. I feel that there is no
benefit at all from advertisement, it plays on minds of people buy more thing that they do
not need it at all.",human
47,43,"It is rather difficult for me to answer the question how I prefer to complain: in writing or in
person because sometimes I just do not have a choice. For example, if I order a product
using the Internet from another state or even country, I will more likely have the
opportunity to speak to a representative of a company in person. So, in some cases I
choose to speak in person and in others I prefer to complain in writing. However, I believe
that every option has its advantages.
From the one side, complaining in writing brings many benefits. First of all, one does not
have to spend his precious time driving, waiting for his turn and talking with a
representative. He can just send mail or e-mail and get all explanation he needs. Second
of all, I think it is the best way to avoid an unpleasant conversation. Personally, I do not
like to complain about anything especially, in person. Finally, sometimes it is impossible to
have a face-to-face conversation because a company which provided a poor product or
service is too far away.
From the other side, complaining in person has some benefits too. First, this type of
complaining provides an immediate feedback. So, if I have some complains about
company's products I will receive all information and explanation right away. However,
sending a company a letter and getting a feedback can take more then a month. Second,
face-to-face conversation is often more effective. People talk to each other, see each
other facial gestures and body movements, which can tell a lot about a person. In addition
to these practical benefits, in the case if one can not receive creditable explanation from
one representative he always can require to talk to another person. For instance, my
husband recently had some extra withdraws from his account by his bank and he was not
aware of it. So, he went to the bank and explained to the bank's representative the
situation and they together found the solution and that money was given back to my
husband's account. I think, in this case face-to-face conversation is the best
way to complain and get feedback fast.
In conclusion, I think that if I have to complain about a product or poor service I will do it in
person. However, if face-to-face conversation is impossible I think I have nothing left but
to send a letter or write an e-mail there.",human
48,44,"Every country has its own culture and traditions. There is no doubt that an advertising
campaign conducted in Russia will not have the same affect here in the United States. Let
us take for example advertisement of food and restaurants.
A huge amount of fast food stands suggest their services for breakfast, lunch, dinner and
supper here in Houston. The competition is very strong. Every week you get in your mailbox an envelope with different types of discounts in exchange for visiting them or ordering
pizza. Watching TV you are also from time to time invited to visit a restaurant in order to
taste some delicious food. It is not because it is easy to make money cooking but
because the demand for such service is high. First of all, people like to go out sometimes
to have dinner with friends. Second of all, it is often impossible to drive home for lunch. It
can be time consuming.
As for Russia, it is a great tradition to have dinner at home with the family and go to the
restaurant for big holidays. Additionally fast food is not popular in Russia. So you will see
advertisements of yogurts, coffee, dairy products and juice instead of restaurants and fast
food stands.
In conclusion I would like to add that in order to succeed in advertising campaign
especially on the international market company must know traditions, language and
history of the country.",human
49,45,"I think that everyone can divide all advertising products and services into useless ones
and useful ones. It is like looking through an information desk when you pay attention to
those messages that interest you. Take me for example.
I do not like jewelry. It does not mean I do not have it at all, I have a couple of inexpensive
rings as gifts from my parents. I just think, people pay too much attention to this stuff. I
believe it is the result of mass advertising. Every day when I am watching TV, listening to
the radio or reading the paper I notice many ads about getting an expensive ring, chain,
necklace or ear-rings. From my point of view these kinds of advertising contaminate
people's minds. In this case you are encouraged to buy things you do not really need.
They make you believe you need such products in order to succeed or be happy.
From the other side, I think that advertisements of the new detergents with up-to-date
formulas to help you maintain your cloth in perfect conditions, the new cars with some
extra futures that make your traveling more comfortable and sports goods that make your
life healthier may help you to improve your life.
Recently my husband and I saw an ad on the Internet about a very interesting and
inexpensive vocation to Japan for a week. Is not it awesome? We like traveling. So now
we are planning to find out more about it and, may be, make reservations. I believe that
without advertisements we would be unaware about plenty of oppotunities that may make
your life happier, easier and less stressful.
My point is that every person has his own scale of values. So if he is vegetarian he will
consider an ad about meat products useless for him.",human
50,46,"The purpose of advertising is to tell the consumer about any new product or service or
any new promotion on the existing product and service. We need it so we can make good
decisions when we go shopping. Advertising tells us when new and improved products
become available and lets us know which ones have the best price.
Through advertising we learn about new products. For example, many grocery stores now
sell prepackaged lunches. These are very convenient for busy parents. They can give
these lunches to their children to take to school. Busy parents don’t have time to look at
every item on the store shelf, so without advertising they might not know about such a
convenient new product.
Even products we are familiar with may be improved, and advertising lets us know about
this. Most people use cell phones, but new types of cell phone service become available
all the time. There are different plans that give you more hours to talk on the phone, you
can send text messages and photos, and next week probably some even newer type of
service will be available. By watching advertisements on TV it is easy to find out about
new improvements to all kinds of products.
Advertisements keep us informed about prices. Prices change all the time, but everyone
can look at the ads in the newspaper and see what the latest prices are. Advertisements
also inform us about sales. In fact, some people buy the newspaper only in order to check
the prices and plan their weekly shopping.
Advertisements improve our lives by keeping us informed about the latest products
developments and the best prices. Advertisements serve a useful purpose.",human
51,48001,"Parents shape their children from the beginning of their children's lives. They teach their
children values. They share their interests with them. They develop close emotional ties
with them. Parents can be very important teachers in their children's lives; however, they
are not always the best teachers.
Parents may be too close to their children emotionally. For example, they may limit a
child's freedom in the name of safety. A teacher may organize an educational trip to a big
city, but a parent may think this trip is too dangerous. A school may want to take the
children camping, but a parent may be afraid of the child getting hurt.
Another problem is that parents sometimes expect their children's interests to be similar to
their own. If the parents love science, they may try to force their child to love science too.
But what if the child prefers art? If the parents enjoy sports, they may expect their child to
participate on different teams. But what if the child prefers to read?
Parents want to pass on their values to their children. However, things change. The
children of today are growing up in a world different from their parents' world. Sometimes
parents, especially older ones, can't keep up with rapid social or technological changes. A
student who has friends of different races at school may find that his parents have
narrower views. A student who loves computers may find that her parents don't
understand or value the digital revolution.
Parents are important teachers in our lives, but they aren't always the best teachers.
Fortunately, we have many teachers in our lives. Our parents teach us, our teachers
teach us, and we learn from our peers. Books and newspapers also teach us. All of them
are valuable.",human
52,48002,"Throughout my life, I have been lucky enough to have a very good relationship with my
parents. They have supported me, given me necessary criticism, and taught me a great
deal about how to live my life. Parents can be very important teachers in our lives;
however, they are not always the best teachers.
Parents may be too close to their children emotionally. Sometimes they can only see their
children though the eyes of a protector. For example, they may limit a child’s freedom in
the name of safety. A teacher might see a trip to a big city as a valuable new experience.
However, it might seem too dangerous to a parent.
Another problem is that parents may expect their children’s interests to be similar to their
own. They can’t seem to separate from their children in their mind. If they love science,
they may try to force their child to love science too. But what if their child’s true love is art,
or writing, or car repair?
Parents are usually eager to pass on their value to their children. But should children
always believe what their parents do? Maybe different generations need different ways of
thinking. When children are young, they believe that their parents are always rights. But
when they get older, they realize there are other views. Sometimes parents, especially
older ones, can’t keep up with rapid social or technology changes. A student who has
friends of all different races and backgrounds at school may find that her parents don’t
really understand or value the digital revolution. Sometimes kids have to find their own
ways to what they believe in.
The most important thing to realize is that we all have many teachers in our lives. Our
parents teach us, our teachers teach us, and our peers teach us. Books and newspapers
and television also teach us. All of them are valuable.",human
53,47,"Freedom plays a mandatory role in everybody?s life. We can see in today?s modernized
era nobody likes to get some restrictions upon them, whether it would be a child or an
adult. Some people think that there should have some strict rules of behaviour for
children, but I disagree with this statement.
Wherever it is a reality that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in
children, which leads to many other mental diseases as well. Morever they can be,
behave like a stubborn. Sometimes they feel themselves under pressure, which can be a
main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children would be
crazier to do these things from where we?ll try to keep them away.
In other words _ we have to look for other aspects as well, like if we usually ignore our
children?s bad habits, then they can?t be good human beings in their future life.
Moreover_ if we never draw attention upon the children?s main activities then they may
be acquiring bad company. They can know regarding the value of respect for their elders.
They can know the importance of relationships. They can know regarding their cultural
values as well.
In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be teach regarding the value of their
customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the extra
restriction should be being avoided. It would be better to make them good human beings
in their coming future.",human
54,49,"There is plenty of evidence to suggest that children are overweight and the situation is
getting worse, according to the medical experts. I feel there are a number of reasons for
this.
Some people blame the fact that we are surrounded by shops selling unhealthy, fatty
foods such as chips and fried chicken, at low prices. This has created a whole generation
of adults who have never cooked a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these
restaurants, then children would not be tempted to buy take-away food.
There is another argument that blames the parents for allowing their children to become
overweight. I tend to agree with this view, because good eating habits begin early in life,
long before children start to visit fast food outlets. If children are given chips and
chocolate rather than nourishing food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat,
they will go for the sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their
lives.
There is a third factor, however, which contributes to the situation. Children these days
take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front
of the television or their computers and play video games. Not only is this an unhealthy
pastime, it also gives them time to eat more junk food. What they need is to go outside
and play active games or sport.
The two views discussed play an equal role in contributing to the problem, but I think we
have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as steering them away from
fast food outlets and bad eating habits. We need to have a balanced approach.",human
55,50,"It has recently been suggested that the way children eat and live nowadays has led to a
deterioration in their health. I entirely agree with this view, and believe that this alarming
situation has come about for several reasons.
To begin with, there is the worrying increase in the amount of processed food that
children are eating at home, with little or none of the fresh fruit and vegetables that earlier
generations ate every day. Secondly, more and more young people are choosing to eat in
fast-food restaurants, which may be harmless occasionally, but not every day. What they
eat there is extremely high in fat, salt and sugar, all of which can be damaging to their
health.
There is also a disturbing decline in the amount of exercise they get. Schools have
become obsessed with exams, with the shocking result that some pupils now do no sports
at all. To make matters worse, few even get any exercise on the way to and from school,
as most of them go in their parents’ cars rather than walk or cycle. Finally, children are
spending far more time at home, playing computer games, watching TV or surfing the
Internet. They no longer play outside with friends or take part in challenging outdoor
activities.
To sum up, although none of these changes could, on its own, have caused widespread
harm to children’s health, there can be little doubt that all of them together have had a
devastating effect. This, in my opinion, can only be reversed by encouraging children to
return to move traditional ways of eating and living.",human
56,51,"Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial
assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and
personality is a much debatable issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for
children for several reasons.
It is said that children learn valuable experience in the work place. This may be true.
However, I would argue that children are mainly employed for jobs that require manual
work and are low paid. The recent statistic reveals the common tasks that children are
assigned are washing dishes, cleaning floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile,
this kind of jobs actually do not provide children with necessary and useful skills so that
they can apply in their future carrer.
This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child work argues that it is an effective
method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to
them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means
that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is
yet to come. They may become so occupied with the benefits ahead of them like small
salary and leave school.
Finally, supporters said that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will
understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have a compassionate view with
their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on
children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is
appropriate to spend on luxury things by their own money, which could be recovered later.
In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child to work,
otherwise it would have a negative consequences on their futures.",human
57,52,"Nobody can say with confidence that children should be taught at home or at any
children's institutions. There are many different children and every one demand of
education suitable only for him.
But for most of children the best way of learning the life is being in the children's
institutions. Nobody would argue that contacts between children of the same age are very
important for bringing your child up. Such a contact is very important for playing,
entertaining and learning living with other people. The harmonious living with other
people, to my mind, is the first task for any man. Lack of this harmony sets problems and
troubles.
The children need space to run and make noise, to jump and cry. Do you or your
neighbours allow these actions for your child? If you live in town, it is difficult to find a safe
place to play. Kindergartens give such a possibility. They give space, a lot of toys and
constructions for physical exercises. So, if you have bad living conditions, the
kindergarten is the best way for you. But if you have a large family with many children and
enough space, you may keep your child at home. You should be sure that the child feels,
dressed and comfortable. His brothers and sisters give him necessary contacts. It's
noticed long ago that children in big families are much more easy-tempered and calm.
They are located in more harmonic world than others.
Sometimes differences in age put troubles in contacts between children in large families.
Then it is better for child to be sent to the kindergarten (school). But if quarrels don't last
for a long time, everything is all right. In general, quarrels develop ability to cooperate with
people. They develop a personal initiative and force setting the balance. In such a way
the child gets lessons of life. Addly, the quarrels often take place in kindergartens and
schools and we shouldn't fear it.
Side by side with quarrels parents often are afraid of colds which happen in kindergartens
more frequently. Parents prefer keeping the child at home. But for a healthy child odd cold
(if illness occurs, it goes its normal course) can't make big harm to the child. And if the
child is adaptable to the conditions of public places earlier it would be better for him in
future.
In general, I am a follower of the theory of keeping children in adapted places such as
good kindergartens. But keeping children in such a place can't replace family and home.
Only together they make harmonic and beautiful union.",human
58,53,"Nowadays, purpose of education being changed in Korea. There are some People who
think that competition in children should be made, also others believe that children who
are taught to co-operate as well as become more usefwl adults. There are advantages
and disadvantages for both of the arguments.
To begin with, what is good if a sense of competition m children is made? They could
develope themselves more and more as they learn and study a lot to win from the
competitbn. To prove this, in Korea, it is popular - even common now - to have a tutor
who come to student's house to teach extra pieces of study with paying a lot of money.
They learn faster than what they learn at school. Furthermore, during the vacations,
students study abroad to learn English for a month instead of revise school work. If they
have experiments such as study abroad, it is one of the greatest plus point to go to the
famous well-known high-school. Moreover, there are four big school exam and two
national examinations to test students' level of studies. Generally, only the highest 40%
can go to the good quatrty highschools and colleges. Children learn as much as they can,
to wim the competition to obtain good quality schools.
On the other hand, as they are busy to enter the schools and study individually with their
own tutors, there are problems. They become selfish. They become careless and don't
help others alot if it is about studies. There will be no co-operations for them. Then, why
are there companies for many people to work in? Each of them are clever, however, there
are weak parts and strong parts for each person. To co-operate is to improve this part.
People talk and listen to what others thmking of and learn. That could also be a great
opportunity to learn instead of learning alone with one teacher.
In conclusion, I strongly agree with that children should be taught to co-operate rather
than compete. Nobody is perfect. People learn together, work together to develop each
other. Therefore, I want parents and teachers to educate children concentrating on cooperation, not compete and ranking them.",human
59,54,"I can not completely agree with the statement that classmates are a more important
influence than parents on a child's success in school. In this essay I will first focus on the
reasons why I agree with this statement and then list a few points why from my opinion in
some cases is not true.
From the one side, classmates have a significant influence on child's behavior and his or
her success in school. First of all, children spend much time at school. Classmates have
many things in common such as age, interests, homework and classes after all. So, they
discuss their impressions about a new teacher, solve problems together, learn their
homework, gain new knowledge and experience and even make their own discoveries.
Sharing all these makes them closer. Some of them become friends and they spend afterschool time together. In addition friends tend to copy each other's habits and manners.
For instance, my little sister became friends with the girl who did not have good grades at
school at that time. It does not mean she could not have better grades; she just had many
friends who did not care about their grades. So, when they started to spend their time
together and share their interests, girl's grades improved. They did their homework
together, shared their dreams and exciting moments. From this point I must agree that
classmates can change child’s attitude towards school.
From the other side, parents have a great influence on children' success in school too.
For example if parents show an interest in their child's progress and talk to him or her
about the importance of learning I think their child will listen to them and do his or her
best.
Personally, I believe that relationships between parents and a child play an essential role
in child's success in school. If these relationships are close and wholehearted I am sure
that parents should not be afraid of bad influence from the outside.",human
60,55,"Some people believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a
big city. However, other people think that a big city gives more opportunities and it is good
for the long run. Personally, for several reasons I think that it is better for children's health
to grow up in the country.
First of all, it is very important for a child to grow up in a healthy environment. Children
need fresh air, not polluted by the huge amount of cars and factories of the modern city.
In the country they can spend more time exercising and walking with their friends.
Scientists say that now children spend the same amount of time watching TV as they do
at school. Probably, the possibility to join their friends for a play will change this
proportion. Another important aspect of this is that parents will have more time to spend
with their children as a result of eliminating traffic jams and decreasing driving time as a
whole. 
From the other side, children have some advantages living in a big city. For example, they
have more opportunities to choose from what they want to do. They can choose to attend
ballet school, school of art, gymnastics, etc. For the long run, it is good for them. They will
be better prepared for a live in a ""real world"" and they will have more chances to make a
good career and succeed. Moreover, a big city usually has many entertaining centers with
movie theatres and play stations. When I was a child I liked to go to the movie theatre
with my parents to watch a premiere.
One more reason to choose a big city for a child is that a city provides better live
conditions and services such as medical, dental, etc. My friend lived in the country for a
while and one time he and his family had to drive a couple of hours to the nearest medical
center when his child got a heavy cough.
To summarize, I agree with those people who want to raise their children in a city. The
plenty of opportunities offered by a city helps children to find what they really like and be
the best at it. Moreover, despite the air pollution, children get a better medical service that
is good for their health.",human

of their time on school studies. This will help them to succeed in the future. However, for
several reasons, which I will explain bellow, I think that children should not study at a very
early age.
Of cause, children who begin to study at a very early age have more chances to succeed
in the future. They gain more knowledge and experience which are priceless and
valuable. In addition, studying more now they will give them the opportunity to perfect
their knowledge in the future and become better professionals.
However, I think that every child must have his or her childhood. Children should learn
through playing and communication with their friends and parents. I think that such basic
qualities as kindness, self-confidence and just a good sense of humor can not be gained
from studying. Children should more time spend with their family, playing and learning
with their parents. Imagine that a child instead of playing with his friends does his
homework and feel exhausted and tired. Another important aspect of this is that children
at their early ages need more exercise because at this age the development of their body
is a very essential aspect. Children first of all must be healthy.
To sum up, I think that children should have their careless childhood with no
responsibilities. Moreover, I am sure that playing helps them develop not only their bones
and muscles but their ability to make decisions, analyze things, make conclusions, which
is very good for their future.",human
62,57,"Language is the best means of communication. In the modern globalization era it is not
enough to be able to speak one language to communicate with the outside world. I
strongly support the idea that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon
as they start school. They faster become familiar with a strange language, improve their
hearing ability to understand new words as time goes by and learn new words. In the
following paragraphs I will list some reasons to support my position.
First of all, if one wants to see outcome soon, one must start sooner. So, the early
children begin to learn new language the better will be the result. Scientists say that a
child does not confuse two different languages but learns them more effectively.
Second of all, adults are often afraid to make mistakes when they are speaking in a new
language. This fear is one of the biggest barriers for a person in his efforts to speak freely.
Otherwise, children do not afraid of making grammatical mistakes because basically they
just repeat words and sentences in the way they hear them. Also, children have a better
chance to get rid of an accent. They faster get used to the right pronunciation and better
feel the melody of a language.
To sum up, I think that it is very essential for children to begin learning a foreign language
in their early ages. It is brings many benefits such as great pronunciation. Also, it helps a
child develop and gain more knowledge which is good for a long run.",human
63,58,"Some parents believe that watching television is bad for their children. So, they try to
restrict their children from watching TV. However, other parents think that there is nothing
bad in watching TV. Personally, I think that watching TV brings children only benefits
unless they spend in front of TV set less then a couple of hours daily. For the following
reasons, which I will mention bellow, I believe that television plays an essential role in
child's development.
First of all, television helps a child to extent his or her range of interests. Children can find
out many new things and make many exiting discoveries for themselves. In addition to
these practical benefits television improves children's vocabulary, their memory and gives
them the opportunity to gain more knowledge. I think it is very essential for a child. Of
cause, someone can say that there are plenty of different recourses of information such
as books and teachers. But, I think, in our modern world children must learn faster and
use all contemporary technology in order to succeed.
Second of all, watching cognitive programs helps children to learn more about wild life,
our environment and about the importance of preserving our forest and wild animals that
live there.
Scientists say that a child should not watch TV more then 40 minutes successively. For
example, my mother always made us have a break after watching TV more then half an
hour and let our eyes rest for several minutes before turning on the TV again. I think it is
the best solution.
To sum up, I believe that television gives children and all people the opportunity to learn
what can not be learn from books. Television and movies in particular allow people to feel
the reality and see what they will most likely not be able to see in their lives. Personally,
when I was a child I liked to watch cognitive programs about wild animals. Unfortunately,
my family had only one TV, but these programs were the only ones we all wanted to
watch. So, we gathered in our living room and watched them in complete silence and I
always remember those moments with a smile on my face.",human
64,59,"Parents are in most cases our first teachers and friends. From my everyday experience I
have to agree with the statement that important decisions should be made by our parents
or adult relatives. In the following paragraphs I will give my reasons to support this
statement.
First of all, teenage children have the tendency to live in their own fantasies. They do not
clearly understand the rules of a real life. When I was 18 years old I thought that the world
was perfect and everything seemed to be simple. Teenagers are basically inexperienced;
they aspire for independence and try to make their first steps towards freedom. I think that
it is like starting to walk when a baby needs its parents for support. An independent life is
a big and significant part in a person's life. So, my point is that it is very important to make
this step right.
Second of all, I think that parents have right to interfere in their children's lives. They need
to know what kind of friends their children have and how children spend their spare time.
For example I had an eighteen years old friend who got really angry with his parents when
they prohibited him to be friends with a young man. Somehow his parents found out that
that young man was occasionally taking drugs. That man was dead in a year because of
drug abuse. After that accident my friend thanked his parents for that interference.
Finally, I think teenage children should be more open-minded with their parents. It will
help them to make the right choice and avoid many mistakes.
To sum up, I believe that young people should trust their parents because they wish their
children only the best.",human
65,60,"Some people believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a
big city. However, other people think that a big city gives more opportunities and it is good
for the long run. Personally, for several reasons I think that it is better for children's health
to grow up in the country.
First of all, it is very important for a child to grow up in a healthy environment. Children
need fresh air, not polluted by the huge amount of cars and factories of the modern city.
In the country they can spend more time exercising and walking with their friends.
Scientists say that now children spend the same amount of time watching TV as they do
at school. Probably, the possibility to join their friends for a play will change this
proportion. Another important aspect of this is that parents will have more time to spend
with their children as a result of eliminating traffic jams and decreasing driving time as a
whole.
From the other side, children have some advantages living in a big city. For example, they
have more opportunities to choose from what they want to do. They can choose to attend
ballet school, school of art, gymnastics, etc. For the long run, it is good for them. They will
be better prepared for a live in a ""real world"" and they will have more chances to make a
good career and succeed. Moreover, a big city usually has many entertaining centers with
movie theatres and play stations. When I was a child I liked to go to the movie theatre
with my parents to watch a premiere.
One more reason to choose a big city for a child is that a city provides better live
conditions and services such as medical, dental, etc. My friend lived in the country for a
while and one time he and his family had to drive a couple of hours to the nearest medical
center when his child got a heavy cough.
To summarize, I agree with those people who want to raise their children in a city. The
plenty of opportunities offered by a city helps children to find what they really like and be
the best at it. Moreover, despite the air pollution, children get a better medical service that
is good for their health.",human
66,61,"The issue about whether children should help with household tasks as soon as they are
able to do so is open for debate. Some people say that children should devote more time
for playing with their friends, watching TV and studying. However, other people believe
that children should help their parents with household tasks. Personally, for several
reasons, which I will explain bellow, I adhere to the latter point of view.
First of all, I think that every child should have his or her own responsibilities. When I was
a child my parents taught me how to make breakfast in the morning. So, I woke up, went
to the kitchen and prepared a couple of toasts for breakfast. It was easy and I enjoyed
doing it because I liked the way my parents thanked me and I felt that they were proud of
me. Also, my mom always wanted me to know how to cook, clean and iron my cloth.
Thanks to the learning, nowadays, when my maid can not come to my house I handle all
household tasks myself.
Second of all, performing household tasks teaches children to value the job of people who
did it. When I was a child I did not imagine that cleaning house could be so time and
energy consuming. So, when I began to do some of the household tasks by myself I
began to respect the job of others and tryed to collect all my toys after my playing with
them.
Finally, doing household tasks teaches children to arrange their time. In addition to those
practical benefits, help from children allows parents to have more spare time for their
personal lives and for the children. A family can have more time to spend with each other
talking, watching movies or just enjoying the beautiful moments.
To sum up, I think that children should help their parents with household tasks. Doing
household tasks helps them to grow into independent, self-confident, and attentive
persons who respect their parents.",human
67,62,"Over the past few decades, the world has significantly changed. Nowadays, many have
begun to wonder what the reasons behind  these changes are. Two major factors
contributing to this phenomenon are advances in media and change family dynamics
[=organization].
First, advances in media, such as the Internet and TV, have meant that children spend a
large portion of their leisure time in front of a screen. Consequently, they are not getting
proper amounts of exercise, which results in an increase in the number of children who
are overweight and obese. In addition, fast food restaurants have become increasingly
popular, which has also contributed to children's health problems
Moreover, another leading force of this trend is changes in the family unit. Compared with
a half century ago, nuclear families have become way more common in modern society.
People tend to have only one child, which has caused personality disorders such as
depression, loneliness, and selfishness. This is mainly because parents with one child
have tendency to put all their focus and money into their only son or daughter. Studies
have indicated that over 65% of children who are brought up without siblings show selfcentered behavior find it difficult cooperating with their peers.
In summary, there are many factors that have caused children to live very differently from
the generation before them. There are high hopes that parents exercise(s) wisdom in
treating their children.",human
68,63,"In past educational institutions, children have been taught together based on age
regardless of intellectual ability displayed at school. Alternatively, a large proportion of the
population believes there should be a strong move towards the separation of children of
different intellectual capabilities in current educational institutions. From my own
educational perspective, I honestly believe that younger students possessing higher
intelligence levels than their peers ought to be separated into alternative levels based on
their gift, for a number of reasons.
Admittedly, although young learners have the chance to learn a lot from associating with
classmates their own age, it is widely believed that such a process isn’t considered to be
vital for a healthy educational upbringing. The argument for intellectual separation holds
some strong advantages. Firstly, by allocating students to classes based on levels of
intelligence, high achievers have the opportunity to excel in a way that they couldn’t in a
normal class. Owing to the fact that they can be placed into an unrestricted educational
environment, students can excel with intellectual freedom.
Secondly, there is a strong argument in regards to inhibiting a child’s intellectual growth
by restricting them from moving above their peers if their mental capability permits. Why
should we limit the intelligence of our future generation? For instance, many of today’s
highly successful artists and entrepreneurs in the world have come from an unrestricted
educational background and have been allowed to explore their mind and careers to the
fullest extent.
In conclusion, although I believe an educational environment for young learners should
promote equal opportunity, I honestly think that creating a more liberal environment which
enhances the learning capabilities of intellectually-gifted children will not only benefit
individual’s careers but future society as a whole.",human
69,64,"Today, education has become a priority for many parents seeking to secure a good future
for their children in this rapidly changing world. They believe that if their children apply
themselves and work hard at school, then they will increase their opportunities for going
to higher education and eventually getting a good job. Of course they are right, and as
access to the best education and best jobs is becoming more competitive, then it is true
that children have to make the best of their study time when they are young.
However, the parents who do not allow their children sufficient free time for leisure
activities outside school hours, are misguided. Such activities are far from being a waste
of time for the children simply because they are not academic. It is important to remember
that children need to develop skills other than intellectual ones, and the best way to do
this is through activities such as sports, games and playing with other kids. If they cannot
play make-believe games, how can they develop their imagination? How can they learn
physical co-ordination or learn important social lessons about winning and losing if they
do not practise any sports? Many children form strong, personal relationships with the
friends they play with, and without the opportunity to do this, they could grow up
emotionally immature or unformed.
Finally, I think it is also important to remember that children need to relax as well as work.
If everything they do must have some educational or academic relevance, then they will
soon get tired of studying altogether, which is the last thing parents would want.",human
70,65,"There have been big changes in the attitudes of most parents over the last few years.
Very few parents would agree with using force regularly as a way of dealing with
discipline problems in their children. Physical punishment is banned in schools in most
countries, and in many countries, there are moves to ban all corporal punishment of
children even in the home. However, many parents still believe that they have a right to
use some physical punishment to deal with certain misbehaviors at certain ages. This
essay will ask if some physical punishment is acceptable today, and will ask how parents
can know what the limits are.
It is easy to find reasons to allow some physical punishment. One issue is that many
parents find it very difficult to abandon physical punishment completely. Parents argue
that this was the way they were brought up themselves and that it didn’t do any harm to
them. They believe that for the child’s sake that they have the right to discipline the child
in any way they see fit, including using corporal punishment. A second point is that
corporal punishment can be quick and effective: there is not much point reasoning with a
screaming child in the supermarket. Finally, most parents are reasonable and fair, and
very very few would ever consider hurting their children by using unnecessary physical
force.
There are several reasons however why we should stop using physical punishment even
in the home. One point is that most parents are not trained to deal with misbehaving
children. They do not have enough resources or choices to handle the situation. As a
result, they immediately react by smacking or hitting the child, even if there are other
solutions to the problem. Another point is that unless people are challenged or forced to
change their beliefs they may keep following negative habits. An example is seatbelt use now most people wear seat belts without thinking, whereas years ago the idea of using
safety belts was strange to most people. In the same way, banning physical punishment
in the home will allow people to change their habits and break a cycle of violence.
However, the most obvious reason for banning all physical punishment of children is to
prevent child abuse. If all parents are allowed to hit their children in the name of discipline,
some parents will go too far and will inflict severe emotional and physical damage on their
children. It may only be a smll minority of parents, but we need to protect all our children.
In conclusion, parents have to change some of their beliefs and ideas about how children
should be raised. It is possible to avoid the use of physical force in the home, and doing
so will help us move closer to dream of removing violence from our society.",human
71,66,"It is often claimed that physical punishment will damage children in later life. Opponents of
corporal punishment claim that the children will grow up to become delinquents or even
beat their wives. However, many happily married adults today were slapped when they
were younger but have never hit their spouses. Another point often made is that physical
punishment teaches children that you can use force to make others do what you want. In
fact children brought up well soon learn that force by itself is nothing - it must be
associated with right. Finally, some people say that punishing a child by smacking him will
damage the relationship between the child and the parents. This is clearly wrong.
Children who understand the reasons for rules will be happier than children who are not
given clear guidelines.
There are definitely concerns about physical punishment. Some parents lose control and
can injure children - even breaking bones or causing bruises. Others can use violence
excessively or as the only method of discipline. In this case, the child will be hurt, fearful
and anxious and will not learn to distinguish right from wrong. The biggest problem with
physical violence is when it is not appropriate to the age of the child. It can be very
effective to quickly smack a two-year-old who is screaming. However, it is not effective to
beat a 16-year-old who is late for school once again.
In conclusion, physical punishment can be a useful method of discipline. However it
should be the last choice for parents. If we want to build a world with less violence we
must begin at home, and we must teach our children to be responsible.",human
72,67,"In most countries in the world, governments require children to attend schools in which
trained teachers are responsible for educating the children using an approved curriculum.
However a significant number of parents believe that it is much better for their children to
be educated at home by the people who know them and their needs best. This essay will
examine the question of home schooling and discuss which the best option for the child is
An increasing number of parents are deciding that home schooling is the best option for
their children. They are unhappy with the quality or depth of education offered in the
schools, or have other reasons why they feel that traditional schools are not suitable for
their children. One reason is social factors. Parents worry that their children will suffer
from bullying or will be forced into antisocial behavior by peer pressure. They believe that
the good behavior they have taught the child will be lost in school. Another reason is
concern over the quality of schooling available. Schools frequently have large classes.
They are often under-funded, and staffed by teachers without sufficient knowledge of their
subjects. Subjects such as the family’s religion or language may not even be available in
the school. Other parents may disagree with the aims of the school curriculum, preferring
for academic, social or cultural reasons to keep their children separate. Finally, some
children with special needs may need particular parental care.
However, there are many arguments in favor of sending children to conventional schools.
The first is that the children will be exposed to other children. These children may
represent either a cross-section of society or a narrow group, but in either case the
children will interact with each other and develop social skills. A second point is that the
children will learn to function outside the family. They will not be dependent on their
parents for their educational, emotional and social needs. A third point is that the children
will find it easier to integrate when they finish school, as they eventually will, when they
start work or college.
Overall, while many parents work hard to teach their children at home, conventional
schools are still the right choice for most children. Schools are not perfect, but they seem
to be a proven way of preparing our children for the real world.",human
73,68,"In this essay, I will discuss whether children or adults make the best learners.
It is undoubtedly true that children seem to learn very quickly. In just a few years, they can
learn how to play a musical instrument, speak one or even two new languages, and deal
with many subjects at school. They even have time for sports and hobbies, and become
experts in their favorite pastimes. However, how much of this is social pressure and how
much is genetic? I am convinced that while children's brains have a natural ability to
absorb new information as part of their developmental growth, much of their achievement
is because of social pressure. Schools force them to take many subjects. Parents force
them to practice new sports or to learn music. Even their playmates force them to become
better at computer games or to read Harry Potter novels faster. In summary, children may
enjoy learning, but their environment also is a big motivating factor.
Adults on the other hand are supposed to be poor learners. However, I disagree with
people who say that adults cannot learn quickly. Adults have many skills that compensate
for the decline in the ability of the brain to grasp and remember new material. They can
organize their learning by setting times for reading or practice. They can build on skills
and experiences they know already. Adults usually cannot learn to do ballet or to play the
violin, but even despite these physical challenges, their motivation can often be higher
than a child's. Unfortunately, society does not encourage many adults to learn. People are
busy with families and work, and some adults may feel that further learning is pointless,
since they have already achieved many goals at work or in their personal life.
In conclusion, I feel that we cannot generalize about children or adults being better
learners. It depends on the situation and the motivation of the person, and the level of
enthusiasm he or she has for learning.",human
74,69,"Over the past few decades, along with growing interest in child education, people's
attention to the family environment where a child is brought up has also significantly
increased. Some people have begun to feel that a child who has grown up in a poor
family tend to be better prepared to deal with problems. In my opinion, however, family
environment alone does not much influence a child's ability to solve problems.
A child who was born into a poor family would have had more situations where they had
to solve a problem or make a decision on their own. This is because in most unfortunate
families, both parents are usually working and children are put into situations where they
have to take care of themselves. By contrast, due to their wealth, rich children can
experience and learn things that unfortunate children cannot. For example, they usually
go to the best schools and receive a higher education there, which prepares them better
for solving problems in their life.
However, few would disagree with the fact that each individual is different. That is,
problem solving skills come more from life experience. That is, the more a person
experiences in life, the more they can use these experiences to adjust, to adapt and to
solve problems they encounter. Personality also can be a factor in dealing with problems.
A person who is optimistic, outgoing, confident and open-minded can look at and solve
problems more effectively.
As discussed above, nature and nurture have an equal influence on a child's ability to
face challenges. Parents should spare no effort to figure out how they can help their
children to be independent. I hope that in the future the next generation will grow up as
mature citizens.",human
75,70,"The question of whether the amount of violence on TV and cinema has affected young
people in our society is something which cannot be quantified or proved. My opinion is
though that the answer is “yes, it has”.
TV and cinema today do show a large amount of violence and, although we try and shield
our young people from seeing too much, they still get to watch it. At the age of eighteen in
my country they can see everything anyway. Violence on the streets has increased. That
has been proved. The connection between TV‛s and the cinema‛s obsession with violence
and today‛s street violence cannot be proved but it is logical that the two are connected.
Young people imitate what they see and it is logical that they see glamour in what they do
when they commit violence.
How can we lessen violence? Reducing the amount of violence on TV and in the cinema
would certainly be a good start. Being more vigilant about what age children are when
they see violence in these media, and raising the age limits would also help. Another
good idea would be to channel the violence of young people. I don‛t think that national
service should be re-established in this country but, if people are convicted of violence
and sent to prison, then why not give them the option of serving in the army. Their
violence will be controlled and they will be subjected to discipline so that they will be
better able to control themselves when they leave.
Thus I agree with the statement that cinema and TV violence affects the young people in
our society. There are some things that can be done to better the situation but I doubt
whether anything will be done.",human
76,71,"Movies tend to have a very large influence on young people who are influenced both by
what they see and hear. Because this is the case, it is true that car chases in action
movies tend to lead to an increase in the number of car accidents among young drivers
because they try to copy what they have seen in the films. They drive too fast and take
unnecessary risks and the difficulty is that most young people lack the skills and
experience to do this.
There are a variety of ways in which young people can be encouraged to practise safer
driving habits. Firstly, the Government should launch a safe driving campaign to convey
the fact that driving safely is not uncool. In effect, it should be cool to stay alive and
healthy! Secondly, every movie should make it clear that dangerous car chases are
undertaken only in strict safety conditions with experienced drivers, and often special
movie-making tricks are used to enhance the action. Thirdly, young people should be
forced to take safe driving courses every year for the first five years that they have their
driver's licence. In this way, they are forced to perfect their driving skills or their licence
will be taken away.
Finally, as part of this course, young drivers should go to hospitals and witness the effects
of poor or dangerous driving on other people. When they see hospitalised people whose
lives have been destroyed due to stupid risk-taking, they will surely change their minds
about whether it is cool to copy action heroes and drive fast.",human
77,72,"Many old people in Britain, after a lifetime of hard work and the toil of bringing up children,
are put into homes for the elderly by their families. There, they are looked after by
professional nurses, and this is sometimes at the expense of the government. However,
this situation has raised controversy about whether we extend to our elders the care and
respect they deserve.
The critics of this system say that it is the duty of the family to look after its senior
members in the years when they are no longer able to work. They point out that in
retirement homes old people tend to feel useless and unwanted by their family members,
who seldom come to see them. In addition, there is evidence that younger people benefit
from the experience and wisdom of older people who live with them on a daily basis.
On the other had, those who support the system say that retired parents can be a burden
to young families. Not only is it expensive to support old people who have little or no
income, but the fact that old people are often ill and need a great deal of looking after can
be too much for their busy children.
In my opinion, neither side is completely right. Old people in good health and with enough
finances to support themselves can be a great help to their children. For instance, they
can look after their grandchildren while children are out at work. On the other had, sick
and penniless old people are better off being looked after in retirement homes at
government expense.",human
78,73,"As human population is significantly rising every year, people's requirements are
increasing too. We need more food, more machines, more place to live. As a result of this
people need more land to satisfy their requirements. We cultivate and irrigate more and
more land to plant vegetables, build new buildings, airports, roads, etc. I think sometimes
we forget that we are not alone on this planet. I have to disagree with those people who
think that human needs are more important than saving land for endangered animals. I
base my opinion on the following points.
First of all, as I already mentioned, we are not alone on this planet. A few centuries ago
we were the part of wild nature. I think we need to remember this fact and respect all
creatures around us.
Second of all, I believe that we all need to think of the problem of overpopulation. The
human population is dramatically increasing and we have to do something about it. From
my opinion, every family should have no more than two children. It will help to stop the
growth of population, decrease human needs for farmland, housing and industry.
In conclusion, I think it is a very topical question nowadays. My point is that all people
should answer this question and find the solution.",human
79,74,"It is clear to me that the idea of a single global currency is an excellent ideal to work
towards. There can be no doubt that trade and travel would be vastly easier. On the other
hand I believe that it would cause problems today.
The benefits of a single currency can be seen with the use in Europe of the Euro.
Whenever you are travelling between countries using the Euro, the problems of currency
changing and exchange rates are history. Similarly business between countries using the
Euros is so much easier; no more worrying about exchange rate risk and pricing.
Everyone‛s money is the same. The same thing is true with the US dollar. Most countries
do not use the US dollar but it is accepted in many places. There are many countries that
you can travel to and just take US dollars to use.
At present though a global currency would be impossible. Firstly most countries would not
accept the idea. Secondly all countries are in different economic states. Some are
economically very strong and some are in a state of collapse with inflation ruining the
economy. Such countries could not be brought into a world currency as it would cause
massive financial instability worldwide. So it is clear that a global currency would indeed
cause some serious problems.
So, in conclusion I see a global currency as a future ideal but it will not happen in my
lifetime. It would make trade and travel much easier but the problems it would cause
nowadays would be insurmountable.",human
80,75,"Different countries have different education systems. I don‛t know all the education
systems in the world but all the ones I do know about have free school education at
primary and secondary level. I certainly agree with the statement that this should be the
case. I believe university education is different.
No matter what standard of income someone has or what society someone comes from,
everyone should have the opportunity to have a good standard of education. This is not
always what happens but it is what should happen. Private schools can be available for
those who want and can afford it but the free schools should always be there. This is
certainly one of the best attributes of western democracy and all countries it seems strive
to attain situation although some have problems due to the economic and political
situations in their countries. Governments should make sure that all their citizens have
access to a good standard of free education at primary and secondary level.
Further education is different. In an ideal world this should be free but governments have
a lot of demands on their money. I think that students should have to pay, maybe not all,
but at least a contribution towards their tuition fees. They will be able to earn it back once
they have graduated. The UK has this system whereas in the US students have to pay all
their high tuition fees which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars over a full
course. I am not sure if I agree with this but it certainly would make sure that students
make the best of efforts to pass or all their money would be wasted.
Therefore I conclude that primary and secondary education should be freely available for
all if possible but that further education should not necessarily be wholly free.",human
81,76,"Social welfare is an essential element of an advanced society. Good systems are always
abused, but that does not mean they are faulty. In my opinion, the two main reasons why
welfare payments are necessary are as follows:
First of all, critics forget that there are many forms of welfare besides payments to the
unemployed. Their negative opinions harm those who are not capable of earning a wage,
such as single-parent mothers, the disabled, and the sick. Moreover, the unemployed
have the right to an income, too. They are not always at fault for not having a job, and in
most cases the tax they have paid in the past entitles them to assistance.
The second reason is that crime increases when people have no means of support. The
desperately poor inevitably turn to crime, which is not only dangerous but costly. Policing
the streets is more expensive than providing welfare. A policeman's wage is four or five
times higher than a ""dole"" payment.
Certain members of society believe that people should look after themselves. They point
out that welfare increases dependency on others and destroys dignity. This may be true,
but in the case of the unemployed, the relief payments are usually temporary. It is surely
the fault of the government if there are long-term unemployed. Welfare critics also believe
that it is the responsibility of a victim's family to provide financial assistance. However, it is
too expensive to provide complete help for a severely disabled person.
To conclude, it is vital to understand the need for welfare in a modern democratic society.
Without welfare payments the poor are destined to become poorer. The first duty of a
government is to provide a financial safety net for all disadvantaged persons, and that
includes those without work.",human
82,77,"In most countries of the world the population is increasing alarmingly. This is especially
true in poor, undeveloped countries. Overpopulation causes a considerable number of
problems.
In poor countries it is difficult to provide enough food to feed even the present number of
people. In addition, education to limit the number of children per family is not always
successful. Poorer countries usually have a lot of unemployment too, and an increase in
population simply makes the situation worse. The environment also suffers when there
are too many people living on the land.
In rich, industrialised and developing countries it is very difficult for governments to
provide effective public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is usually a great
deal more crime, which is often due to high rates of unemployment. Further large
increases in population only cause more overcrowding, unemployment and crime.
There are two main solutions to the overpopulation problem. Firstly, every woman who is
pregnant, but who does not want to give birth, should be allowed by law to have an
abortion. Secondly, governments must educate people to limit the size of the family. In
China, couples are penalised financially if they have more than one child. This may seem
cruel, but the ""one-child policy"" is beginning to have an effect in the world's most populous
nation. Eventually, similar policies might also be necessary in other crowded nations such
as India, for example.
To sum up, if the population explosion continues, many more people will die of starvation
in poor countries, and life in the cities, even in affluent nations, will become increasingly
difficult.",human
83,78,"It is certainly true that the position of women in society has undergone a dramatic change
in the past twenty years but I do not feel that this is a direct cause of the indisputable
increase in juvenile-related problems during this period.
It is now accepted that young women should find work on leaving school; indeed to rely
totally on their parents' financial support is no longer an option in many families. Likewise,
once they get married, the majority of women continue working since the financial
pressures of setting up a house and establishing a reasonable standard of living often
require two incomes.
Twenty years ago it was common for women to give up work once they had children and
devote their time to caring for their children. This is no longer the general rule and the
provision of professionally-run child care facilities and day nurseries have removed much
of the responsibility for child rearing that used to fall to mothers. However, these facilities
come at a cost and often require two salaries coming into a family to be afforded.
I do not believe that the increase in the number of working mothers has resulted in
children being brought up less well than previously. Indeed it could be argued that by
giving mothers the opportunity to work and earn extra money children can be better
provided for than previously. There is more money for luxuries and holidays and a more
secure family life is possible. Of course there are limits as to the amount of time that
ideally should be spent away from home and the ideal scenario would be for one of the
parents (often the wife) to have a part-time job and thus be available for their children
before and after school. It is important to establish the correct balance between family life
and working life.",human
84,81,"Before talking about the essential role of death penalty, you have to think about the
meaning, and the purpose, of any kind of punishment. If you consider that the purpose is
to prevent the guilty from being nasty again, you can be seduced by an argumentation in
favour of the suppression of capital punishment. But you have to think about another
aspect of the problem: a punishment is also useful to impress people, to make them fear
the law. In fact, let's take the example of a young misfit, which has grown in a violent
atmosphere, influenced by older delinquents, etc ... He lives in the streets, he's got no aim
but to survive. This is the kind of person who could possibly kill someone for money, or
even for fun ... Why would he fear prison? Life would be easier for him there. In addition,
in many cases, when you behave normally, you can benefit from penalty reductions. This
young misfit needs to be impressed, he needs to know that the law is a frontier. When you
cross it, you can lose your life. That is why capital punishment helps keeping a distance
between robbery and murder. If you abolish it, you suppress the difference between these
two types of crime, which are completely different.
But there is also a limit to define: even if death penalty is unavoidable, it would be a crime
to apply it to inadequate cases. If there is no premeditation or past facts which can justify
such a punishment, it is far too strict to apply death penalty. That is why the lawmakers
have to establish precisely the context in which capital punishment car be pronounced.
That is the price to pay to limit violence without using excessive violence.
Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must
acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty but others are totally in
favour. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th
century, tolerance and respect for life are important values. Moreover, we can affirm that
all the Europe remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point,
life respect is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.
Those who are in favour of capital punishment are particularly in radical countries. It is not
surprising to watch some barbarian behaviours in Islamic countries like public stoning to
death. The population is invited to participate on the trial and in the final sentence - deathitself. However, this is not just an image of third world countries. Actually, USA is where this kind of punishment has its higher rates. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top,
supporting this measure against crime, especially those related with serial killers and
those involving children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is
foreseen that this penalty will continue into a future next.
Maybe this is not a clear question. As we can see there are several values here and of
course cultural behaviours. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and
even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show those divisions. The
solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. It will
be better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that life sentence could be
a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate
psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some
murderers and other perverted people will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital
punishment is a soft release.",human
85,82,"The idea that a marriage should be arranged by the parents of the couple, or by other
members-of the family, is quite acceptable to some societies, yet completely out of the
question for others. It all depends on your cultural expectations.
In so-called western societies, it is very unusual for marriages to be arranged. Most young
people would not welcome the idea that their parents have the right to choose their
partner for life. They feel that arranged marriages deny them their fundamental right to
choose, even if they make a bad decision.
However, if we are honest about it, we might acknowledge that some parents organise
their children's lives in such a way that they are likely to meet and marry partners the
parents approve o£ It could be said that this is, to some extent, similar to an arranged
marriage. It is always better when families support the relationship and welcome the
grandchildren.
People for whom arranged marriages are the cultural norm often argue that the likelihood
of the marriage lasting is greater when it is set up in this manner. Parents can be assured
that their children are joining a family of similar standing and cultural background, and
this, in the long run, makes for a more stable society if your parents' marriage was
arranged, and has worked well, then why should you question the custom?
The important thing to ensure is that people are never forced into a marriage which will
make them unhappy or lead to an unequal relationship where one partner is exploited by
the other. This applies in all societies and situations.",human
86,83,"The view that women are better parents than men has shown itself to be true throughout
history. This is not to say that men are not of importance in child- rearing indeed, they are
most necessary if children are to appreciate fully the roles of both sexes. But women have
proven themselves superior parents as a result of their conditioning, their less aggressive
natures and their generally better communication skills.
From the time they are little girls, females learn about nurturing. First with dolls and later
perhaps with younger brothers and sisters, girls are given the role of carer. Girls see their
mothers in the same roles and so it is natural that they identify this as a female activity.
Boys, in contrast, learn competitive roles far removed from what it means to nurture.
While boys may dream of adventures, girls' conditioning means they tend to see the
future in terms of raising families.
Girls also appear to be less aggressive than boys. In adulthood, it is men, not women,
who prove to be the aggressors in crime and in war. Obviously, in raising children, a more
patient, gentle manner is preferable to a more aggressive one. Although there certainly
exist gentle men and aggressive women, by and large, females are less likely to resort to
violence in attempting to solve problems.
Finally, women tend to be better communicators than men. This is shown is intelligence
tests, where females, on average, do better in verbal communication than males. Of
course, communication is of utmost importance in rearing children, as children tend to
learn from and adopt the communication styles of their parents.
Thus, while it is all very well to suggest a greater role for men in raising children, let us not
forget that women are generally better suited to the parenting role.

87,84,"There is much discussion nowadays as to whether or not the relation-ship between family
members is as close as before. Diverse contributing factors can be identified. In the
following, I would like to present my point of view.
Great changes have taken place in family life along with the development of society. One
of them is that the once-extended family tends to become smaller and smaller. Many
children have to leave their parents at an early age to study or work elsewhere. As time
passes, children become emotionally estranged from their parents.
Compared with the past, social competition is becoming increasingly fierce. People are
urged to concentrate their efforts upon work, so that they can achieve success, or at least
a good standard of living. As a result, they can’t afford to spend their leisure hours with
their families. The importance of bonds of kinship is gradually fading from their minds.
In addition, the availability of various kinds of recreational facilities also diverts people
from enjoying chats with the members of their families. Their free time is mostly occupied
by watching TV, surfing the Internet or playing video games. They come to lose interest in
communicating with the other members of their families.
In view of such alienation within families, urgent steps must be taken, in my opinion. For
members of families who live away from one another, regular contact on the phone can
bring them the care that they need. Family reunions on holidays or other important
occasions can make a difference as well. For those living together, it is a good idea to
take some time off work or recreation periods to spend more time with each other. In the
final analysis, a close family relationship can surely be maintained as long as we realize
the significant role it plays in our lives and attach importance to it.",human
88,85,"I believe that child-rearing should be the responsibility of both parents and that, whilst the
roles within that partnership may be different, they are nevertheless equal in importance.
In some societies, it has been made easier over the years for single parents to raise
children on their own. However, this does not mean that the traditional family, with both
parents providing emotional support and role-models for their children, is not the most
satisfactory way of bringing up children.
Of crucial importance, in my opinion, is how we define 'responsible for bringing the
children up'. At its simplest, it could mean giving the financial support necessary to
provide a home, food and clothes and making sure the child is safe and receives an
adequate education. This would be the basic definition.
There is, however, another possible way of defining that part of the quotation. That would
say it is not just the fathers responsibility to provide the basics for his children, while his
wife involves herself in the everyday activity of bringing them up. Rather, he should share
those daily duties, spend as much time as his job allows with his children, play with them,
read to them, help directly with their education, participate very fully in their lives and
encourage them to share his.
It is this second, fuller, concept of 'fatherhood' that I am in favour of, although I also
realise how difficult it is to achieve sometimes. The economic and employment situation in
many countries means that jobs are getting more, not less, stressful, requiring long hours
and perhaps long journeys to work as well. Therefore it may remain for many a desirable
ideal rather than an achievable reality.",human
89,86,"With the advent of globalization, a common language to facilitate trade and
communication seems inevitable. Some oppose the development of a single language on
the grounds that it may lead to cultural erosion and a loss of local linguistic knowledge.
Yet, I am of the opinion that it is possible to use an official international language and still
retain one’s own language and culture.
Firstly, many countries already use an official language or languages. For example, in
India there are two official languages: Hindi and English. In a country such as India where
there are innumerable languages spoken, there is a need for official languages to ensure
communication between different sections of the population and the different states. In
China, where different dialects are spoken, Mandarin, the official language, enables
people from different provinces to comprehend each other.
Secondly, in an age of rampant globalization there is no doubt that an international
language is inevitability. How is an African businessman going to conduct business in
China when there are such differences between languages? In this sense, not only is an
international language inevitable, but also a necessity for trade, commerce and economic
expansion in the 21st century.
The critics opposing the adoption of an international official language argue that it would
lead to a loss of cultural identity. However, the use of an international official language
doesn’t mean that local languages will die out. For example, English already functions as
a kind of unofficial international language but this doesn’t mean that people solely
converse in English or they neglect their own language. English is used in specific
contexts (trade, business, etc) and native languages are used for everyday instruction.
In brief, as the world becomes smaller the need for an official international language
seems unavoidable. English has already assumed this role although its status is
unofficial. In my view, the use of either an official or unofficial international language is
necessary to facilitate communication in a time of rapid globalization.",human
90,87,"In our modern stressful world we often forget about our customs and traditions. However,
I think that people should keep their traditions because they help to remember our
forefathers and value the beautiful moments we have in our lives.
In my country we have a great custom called ""Maslenica"". It is a holiday, which is
celebrated at the end of the winter. Many people gather on the biggest square of the city
and see of the winter. They say to the winter good-bye and ask the spring to change the
winter. They celebrate the beginning of the life when everything starts to grow.
People at this holiday bake pancakes and treat each other with them. Also, many people
gathered on the square play different games. For example, the most well-known game
""pulling a rope"" subsists in that two teams pull a rope. The winner is the team, witch has a
longer rope. Other people draw on the icy pole. People have fun at this holiday even if
they just observe those games and do not participate.
In conclusion, I am sure that ""Maslenica"" would benefit many countries all over the world.
People have the opportunity to relax, leave their troubles and worries behind and have
fun. Also, this holiday helps people to find out more about each other, communicate and
meet new people. In addition to those practical benefits, ""Maslenica"" helps people to slow
down their life pace and enjoy the present moments that are irreplaceable and
beautiful.",human
91,88,"People may choose to keep their old traditions from their native country or to accept new
ones. Keeping the old customs will help one to overcome the cultural shock and the
change of the environment. From the other side, accepting the new traditions will help one
to adapt and make new friends with residents. In this essay I will give different reasons
why people decide to follow the customs of the new country or to keep their own customs.
If one is from the country with strong and old traditions, I think it will be rather difficult for
him to adapt to the new customs and moreover to reject his own. That is why some
people from the same country try to live together and to create their own community
where the old traditions are kept. They can not break the customs that were created by
their ancestors. For example, some nations are restricted in certain kinds of food by their
traditions. So, they do not go to the restaurants unless their traditional food is served
there. Some nations according to their customs have to wear certain types of cloth
because their religion tells them to do so.
From the other side, if one is from the country with traditions similar to ones of the new
country it will be easy for him to adopt and to follow the customs of the new place. He will
not feel much difference. Probably, the most difficult part of his relocation will be to
accustom to the new climate.
I think that people of the new country are friendlier when they see that foreigner follows
their customs. I belief that traditions of every country deserve respect, especially, when
one lives there. In summary, I think that every country has its own beauty and if one
wants to find out more about it he will love it.",human

herd of mammoths on the walls of the cave to these days when he can chart with
someone on the other side of the globe. Modern technology is rapidly changing the
world's living standards that results in creating a single world culture. New technologies
including Internet, television, electronic media, means of transportation, etc has a great
impact on creating a similar culture all around the globe. Bellow I will list my reasons to
support my opinion.
First of all, Internet and e-mail have changed the way people communicate to each other.
Internet brought many benefits. It is a new means of communication, a fast access to
information and news. People communicate with each other, share their ideas, happiness
and difficulties. We have a great opportunity to find out more about countries and their
history.
Second of all, the modern means of transportation allows people to move from one place
to another very quickly. A few centuries ago it was impossible to imagine waking up in
one country and falling asleep in another.
Finally, as a result of all mentioned above the boundaries between countries, their
traditions and customs are erased. Many people migrate during their lives. Some of them
are looking for a better place to live, others want to get new experience and knowledge or
just pleasure. So, many families are created between people from different countries.
Traditions fuse and evolve into other ones or just vanish.
To sup up, modern technology has a great impact on the way people live now. It is
creating a new single world culture where traditions and distances are no longer of that
importance.",human
93,90,"Most of the firms, organization and companies as well as Government make restrictions to
smoke in work places and public amenities respectively. It has become fashionable in the
world today to blame smoking. However, although I feel that smoking can be harmful, but
I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have
the right whether they smoke or not.
Let me deal with the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many
people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset owing to
debt or they have exam, like to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. Most of the
people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments
throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained
from taxes provide funds which are used for building school, hospital and public places
such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also
employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries
like Zimbabwe or India. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.
Despite these positive effects there are lots of negative effects of smoking too. Initially,
smoking has been proven to be too dangerous for health. As one cigarette contain more
then 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it causes for many injurious diseases like heart
attacks, asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer and cough. According to the current report, in
Britain about 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed
by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs government millions of dollars because of the
large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems.
Moreover, there is also concern today about passive smoking. Recent research shows
that non-smokers can suffer health problems if they spend long period of time among
people who do smoke. In UK children whose parents are smoke are three times as likely
to start smoking themselves.
In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the
decision as to whether smoke or not should be for each individual to make. I suggest
people should not smoke in a room or place where there are non smokers but surely they
should be free to smoke elsewhere.",human
94,91,"Recently, a hostile debate arouse when a few well reputable health organizations
suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition. In this
assay, I will analyse why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our
youngsters safety, according to my vision.
Firstly , tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the later addictive
effect. Nicotin , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on
smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by scientist on animals, specailly
rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead by time to dependency, just similar to the
effect experienced with herion.
Secondly, restriction on cigerattes selling will surely show an instant decline in tobacco
smoking. ” Having an easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, specially on
teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of Pschycology department at
Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the
severity of smoking is equivilant to other lethal drugs usage woulod be a life saving
step,they will thank us for() as they get older.” he continues.

positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.",human
95,92,"Youth drug abuse is a serious problem nowadays in many cultures. Not only is illegal drug
use on the rise, but children as young as 10 years old are experimenting with alcohol and
tobacco. The reasons for this behaviour are unclear, but certain sociologists blame the
examples set by their elders.
Parents who drink and smoke to excess are, in effect, telling their children that it is
acceptable to abuse their bodies with drugs. Consequently, children may have a similar
view towards illegal drugs, even if their parents are against their use. In addition, drug use
shown on television and in films can only confuse children who are also taught at school
that drug abuse is wrong.
The pressure on young people to perform well at school in order to compete for jobs is a
possible cause of the problem. Many believe they cannot live up to their parents'
expectations, and feel a sense of hopelessness. Also, the widespread availability of drugs
means teenagers are faced with the temptation to experiment. Drugs are used as a
means of expressing dissatisfaction with the pressures they face in society.
The effects of drug abuse are well known. Many young people's talents are wasted, and
addiction to hard drugs can cost a user his or her life. Furthermore, those who drink and
drive may be involved in fatal road accidents. The cost to society is great, and enormous
amounts of money are spent on convicting drug dealers and on education programmes.
To conclude, I recommend that the only sensible way to solve this problem is to educate
young people about the dangers of drug use, and to take steps to reduce the pressure of
competition placed upon them.",human

preventing drug use, treating addicts, and fighting drug-related crime. Although drugs
threaten many societies, their effects can also be combated successfully. This essay
looks at some of the effects of drug use on society, and suggests some solutions to the
problem.
Drug abuse causes multiple problems for countries and communities. The medical and
psychological effects are very obvious. Addicts cannot function as normal members of
society. They neglect or abuse their families, and eventually require expensive treatment
or hospitalization. The second effect is on crime. Huge police resources are needed to
fight smuggling and dealing. Criminal gangs and mafia underworlds develop with the
money from drugs.
However, the menace of drugs can be fought. Education is the first battle. Children need
to be told at home and in school about drugs. People need to be aware of the effects so
that they can make avoid this problem. A second approach is to increase police
manpower and powers to stop dealers and to enforce the law. However the main target
should be the user. Families and counselors need to talk to children and people at risk.
Parents need to look at their children and help them to Jobs are needed to give people a
role in society.
In conclusion, although the problem of drugs may seem impossible to eliminate, there are
concrete steps that can be taken to weaken the hold of drugs on society. The danger from
drugs is too great to ignore.",human

feel that smoking can be harmful, I do not think it should be banned completely.
Let me deal first with the positive side of smoking. First, smoking undoubtedly helps many

before exams or when they are relaxing with friends.
A further point is that governments throughout the world make huge profits from levying

non-smokers can suffer health problems if they spend long periods of time among people

98,95,"Everyone has the choice of being a smoker or not. The people who choose to smoke do
so knowing there is a risk of causing harmful damage to themselves. However, I do not
entirely agree that these people should have to pay more to receive all the medical
treatment they need.
I think there are many situations in which a medical problem has nothing to do with
whether a person smokes or not. In these cases, where an illness has no relation to
smoking, then I believe that smokers should not be required to pay more than other
people for their medical treatment. Most car accidents, for example, have no connection
with smoking, and the people who are injured ought to have the same medical help,
regardless of the cost. And what about the common flu - it does not seem justifiable to me
that a smoker should have to pay more to see a doctor for an illness we can all contract.
On the other hand, I agree that a smoker should pay more than a non-smoker for the
necessary treatment of any condition which has been caused by smoking. The principle
that people should take responsibility for their own actions is a good one. Consequently, if
a person chooses to smoke knowing that this habit can cause serious health problems,
then there is no reason why the community or an insurance company should have to pay
for medical treatment for an illness which could have been avoided.
In many countries, cigarette packets have a clear warning that smoking can cause health
problems and so no smoker can claim not to know the danger. Lung cancer is sometimes
a fatal disease and the treatment is both lengthy and expensive, and it is unfair for the
smoker to expect the hospital or the community to carry the cost. In fact, it could also be
argued that those who smoke in public should be asked to pay extra because of the
illness caused to passive smokers.
In conclusion, I feel that smokers should pay more in cases related to smoking, but for
any other illness they should pay the same as anyone else.",human
99,96001,"Some people argue that the state does not have the right to make parents immunise their
children. However, I feel the question is not whether they should immunise but whether,
as members of society, they have the right not to.
Preventative medicine has proved to be the most effective way of reducing the incidence
of fatal childhood diseases. As a result of the widespread practice of immunising young
children in our society, many lives have been saved and the diseases have been reduced
to almost zero.
In previous centuries children died from ordinary illnesses such as influenza and
tuberculosis and because few people had immunity, the diseases spread easily. Diseases
such as dysentery were the result of poor hygiene but these have long been eradicated
since the arrival of good sanitation and clean water. Nobody would suggest that we
should reverse this good practice now because dysentery has been wiped out.
Serious diseases such as polio and smallpox have also been eradicated through national
immunisation programmes. In consequence, children not immunised are far less at risk in
this disease-free society than they would otherwise be. Parents choosing not to immunise
are relying on the fact that the diseases have already been eradicated. If the number of
parents choosing not to immunise increased, there would be a similar increase in the risk
of the diseases returning.
Immunisation is not an issue like seatbelts which affects only the individual. A decision not
to immunise will have widespread repercussions for the whole of society and for this
reason, I do not believe that individuals have the right to stand aside. In my opinion
immunisation should be obligatory.",human
100,96002,"The issue of whether we should force parents to immunise their children against
common diseases is, in my opinion, a social rather than a medical question. Since we are
free to choose what we expose our bodies to in the way of food, drink, or religion for that
matter, why should the question of medical 'treatment' be any different?
Medical researchers and governments are primarily interested in overall statistics and
trends and in money-saving schemes which fail to take into consideration the individual's
concerns and rights. While immunisation against diseases such as tetanus and whooping
cough may be effective, little information is released about the harmful effects of
vaccinations which can sometimes result in stunted growth or even death.
The body is designed to resist disease and to create its own natural immunity through
contact with that disease. So when children are given artificial immunity, we create a
vulnerable society which is entirely dependent on immunisation. In the event that mass
immunisation programmes were to cease, the society as a whole would be more at risk
than ever before.
In addition there is the issue of the rights of the individual. As members of a society, why
should we be obliged to subject our children to this potentially harmful practice? Some
people may also be against immunisation on religious grounds and their needs must also
be considered.
For these reasons I feel strongly that immunisation programmes should not be obligatory
and that the individual should have the right to choose whether or not to participate.",human
101,97,"Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from
treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Of course it goes without saying that prevention is better than cure. That is why, in recent
years, there has been a growing body of opinion in favour of putting more resources into
health education and preventive measures. The argument is that ignorance of, for
example, basic hygiene or the dangers of an unhealthy diet or lifestyle needs to be
combatted by special nationwide publicity campaigns, as well as longer-term health
education.
Obviously,there is a strong human argument for catching any medical condition as early
as possible. There is also an economic argument for doing so. Statistics demonstrate the
cost-effectiveness of treating a condition in the early stages, rather than delaying until
more expensive and prolonged treatment is necessary. Then there are social or economic
costs, perhaps in terms of loss of earnings for the family concerned or unemployed
benefit paid by the state.
So far so good, but the difficulties start when we try to define what the 'proportion' of the
budget should be, particularly if the funds will be 'diverted from treatment'. Decisions on
exactly how much of the total health budget should be spent in this way are not a matter
for the non-specialist, but should be made on the basis of an accepted health service
model.
This is the point at which real problems occur - the formulation of the model. How do we
accurately measure which health education campaigns are effective in both medical and
financial terms? How do we agree about the medical efficacy of various screening
programmes, for example, when the medical establishment itself does not agree? A very
rigorous process of evaluation is called for, so that we can make informed decisions.

102,98,"Studying a language in a country where it is widely spoken has many advantages. It is,
therefore, a good idea to study English in a country such as Britain. However, I believe it
is not the only way to learn the language.
In the first place, most students in non-English-speaking countries learn English at
secondary school, and sometimes at university nowadays. Although their spoken English
is not usually of a very high standard, their knowledge of grammar is often quite
advanced. This is certainly useful when students come to an English-speaking country to
perfect the language.
Secondly, studying the basics of English at secondary school is less stressful than
learning the language while overseas. This is because students living at home do not
have to worry about problems such as finding accommodation, paying for their study and
living costs, and trying to survive in a foreign country where day to day living causes much
stress.
However, there are obvious advantages of learning English in Britain. Every day there are
opportunities to practise listening to and speaking with British people. Also, students can
experience the culture firsthand, which is a great help when trying to understand the
language. This is especially true if they choose to live with a British family, as exchange
students for example. Furthermore, if students attend a language school full-time, the
teachers will be native speakers. In this case, not only will students' speaking and
listening skills improve, but attention can be given to developing reading and writing skills
as well.
In general, even though it is preferable to study English in an English-speaking country, a
reasonable level of English can be achieved in one's own country, if a student is gifted
and dedicated to study.
",human
103,99,"It can be argued that a nation maintains its culture through its language, and so there is a
need to restrict the use of foreign words and changes in pronunciation. However, in reality
this approach is fruitless, because language is a living thing and it is impossible to stop it
from changing. This policy has been tried in some countries, but it never works. People,
especially young people, will use the language that they hear around them, and which
separates them from others; stopping the use of certain words will only make them
appear more attractive.
As for spelling, we all know that the English system is irregular and, I believe, it would
benefit from simplification so that children and other learners do not waste time learning to
read and write. On the other hand, some people may feel, perhaps rightly, that it is
important to keep the original spelling of words as a link with the past and this view is also
held by speakers of languages which do not use the Roman alphabet.
While it is important for people who speak a minority language to be able to learn and use
that language, it is practical for education to be in a common language. This creates
national pride and links people within the society. Realistically, schools are the best place
for this to start.
Ultimately, there is a role for governments to play in the area of language planning,
particularly in education, but at no time should governments impose regulations which
restrict people's linguistic freedom.

speaking countries. I am an engineer in a process control since ten years and I
understand the necessity of English language. For example, when I read technical
English specifications, when I meet Japanese Industrials to build together some electronic
materials or when I go on holidays in Italy where the best way (for me) to communicate is
to speak English. Therefore, today, it's necessary to learn English and the best way is to
study in English as soon as possible when we are at school but also when we have a job.

105,101,"""Do as I say, not as I do."" This is what society tells us when it punishes murderers with the
death penalty. Society tells us that murder is wrong, and in our legal system, murder is
against the law. Yet we still see our society kill murderers, and thus we are committing
murder ourselves. For this reason, the death penalty should end, and instead murderers
should be punished with life in prison.
Society needs to show a positive model of how our lives should be and how people
should act. We should always strive to improve our situation, to be at peace and in
harmony with others. However, when we kill murderers, we are not working to improve
our society. Instead, we are stooping to the criminals' level.
It makes me think about the revenge that came when playing games with my brothers.
When we were kids/children, my brother would take my toys, so I would hit him and take
my toys back. Then he would hit me harder and take the toys again. Thinking of the death
penalty, I imagine a murderer kills someone. Society takes revenge by killing the
murderer. This leaves behind the murderer's family and friends, who have tremendous
anger inside of them, which they may release onto society. The cycle of killing goes on
and on.
Society should not condemn people who are taking the same action that society is taking.
Society tells us not to kill, and yet society kills when it exercises the death penalty.
Because of this contradiction, we should end the death penalty and instead punish
murderers by sentencing them to life in prison.",human
106,1021,"Every year, millions of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific
research into the effects of drugs, food additives, cosmetics and other chemical products.
While most people think animal testing is necessary, others are upset by what they see as
needless suffering. This essay looks at some of the positive and negative aspects of
animal testing.
Many medical treatments and procedures have been developed from experiments on
animals. Since animals share many features with humans, scientists use animals to test
the safety and effectiveness of newly developed drugs before pilot testing on small groups
of patients. Medical teams practice new operating techniques such as transplants on
animals. Without animal testing, many procedures or new drugs would be extremely
unsafe.
However, many people are concerned that animals are suffering unnecessarily and
cruelly. They do not believe that every new drug needs to be tested on animals, especially
with the huge database of knowledge and modern computer models. They also are
worried that many animal tests are ineffective, pointing out that any drugs have had to be
withdrawn from the market despite extensive testing. They particularly feel that animal
testing should not be used for non-essential products such as cosmetics, shampoos,
soaps, and cleaning products. Furthermore, some campaigners would like to see certain
tests replaced and more humane methods used.
We need to make sure that the millions of animals who are used for testing new products
are treated with the minimum of suffering. Although some animal testing may be
unavoidable at present, treating our fellow creatures as mercifully as possible will
demonstrate our humanity.",human
107,1022,"Every day, thousands of people are saved from painful diseases and death by powerful
medical drugs and treatments. This incredible gift of medicine would not be possible
without animal testing. Despite these overwhelming benefits, however, some people are
calling for animal testing to be banned because of alleged cruelty. This essay will examine
arguments for and against animal testing.
Those against the use of animal testing claim that it is inhumane to use animals in
experiments. I disagree completely. It would be much more inhumane to test new drugs
on children or adults. Even if it were possible, it would also take much longer to see
potential effects, because of the length of time we live compared to laboratory animals
such as rats or rabbits.
Opponents of animal testing also claim that the results are not applicable to humans. This
may be partly true. Some drugs have had to be withdrawn, despite testing. However, we
simply do not have alternative methods of testing. Computer models are not advanced
enough, and testing on plants is much less applicable to humans than tests on animals
such as monkeys. Until we have a better system, we must use animal testing.
A further point often raised against animal testing is that it is cruel. Some of the tests
certainly seem painful, but the great majority of people on this planet eat meat or wear
leather without any guilt. Where is their sympathy for animals? Furthermore, animals
clearly do not feel the same way as humans, and scientists are careful to minimize stress
in the animals, since this would damage their research.
I agree that we need to make sure that animals who are used for testing new products
have the minimum of suffering. However, I am convinced that animal testing is necessary,
and that it will continue to benefit humans in new and wonderful ways.",human
108,1032,"Advantages of Animal Testing in Medical Research
Medical research involving animals has dramatically improved the health of the human
race. Without animal testing, the cure for polio would not exist and diabetics would suffer
or die from their disease. Despite these benefits, some people believe that animals should
be not be used for testing medical techniques and drugs. This essay will outline the
advantages of animal testing.
Animal testing allows scientists to test and create new drugs. Animals such as monkeys
or rabbits have similar physical processes to humans. This allows scientists to test the
effects of certain drugs. If a drug produces adverse effects in animals it is probably unfit
for human use.
Animal testing is cheap. There is a large supply of animals for medical research. Animals
are easily bred, and maintained safely in controlled labs. The costs of testing in humans
would be extremely high.
Many people argue that animal testing is cruel. In some cases this is true. However it
would be much more cruel to test new drugs on people or children, or to let people die
because there was not enough information about a drug. Furthermore, legislation in most
countries sets standards for animal treatment, and laboratories have guidelines to prevent
cruelty.
Opponents of animal research also say that information from animals does not apply to
humans. They point to certain commercial drugs which have been withdrawn because of
side-effects in humans While it is true that animal systems differ from human systems,
there are enough similarities to apply information from animals to humans.
Animal rights campaigners claim that we don’t need new tests because we already have
vast amounts of information. However, many new deadly infections appear every year
and new treatments and drugs are needed to combat these deadly plagues.
Animal testing is needed in the world we live in. Our responsibility is to manage the
animals in our care and balance their suffering against the good that comes from them.",human
109,1031,"I live in a small community. From my everyday experience and observation I can say that
the idea about building a new theatre in my neighborhood has some advantages as well
as disadvantages. In this essay I will first focus on the reasons why I support this idea and
then move on to analyzing why I oppose it.
First of all, I like movies and my husband and I sometimes go to the movie theatre to
watch premieres. Unfortunately, it is time-consuming for us. We have to drive about 50
minutes to the nearest movies theatre. So, the idea of having a movie theatre in our
neighborhood seems very attractive. It would save us an hour just to get there and
another hour to get back home. Another important aspect of it is that in this case we will
be able to get to the movie theatre by foot. I must to confess that we always have parking
troubles in the parking space near the movie theatre.
Second of all, new movie theatre is a very good place for students who want to earn some
money. My husband and I live near a student community, so I think it would be a great
news for them. In addition to this practical benefit students will be able to watch all movies
free of charge. I suppose it is a great way to save some money.
Finally, there are usually many restaurants and entertaining centers around a movie
theatre. There people can have dinner or play game machines.
In contrast, I think that the building of a new movie theatre will destroy the silence and
beauty of out community. Such entertaining centers are often noisy. Moreover, traffic jams
will probably be the result of it.
In conclusion, I think that if the question was about building a new movie theatre in the
next neighborhood I would completely agree.",human
110,1041,"I am from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I believe that building a large factory near my
community has advantages as well as disadvantages. In the following paragraphs I will
list basic benefits and losses that will be brought by a new factory.
For several reasons, I think that a new factory will not be a good addition to my
neighborhood. First of all, factories often bring pollution. They are prone to contaminating
the local air and water. Second of all, factories make noise. Another important aspect of
building a new factory near by is that it will make the local traffic heavy. As a result of this,
the amount of traffic congestions will increase, as well as contamination of the air. So, all
these obviously will not make one's life happier and healthier in my community.
From the other side, I believe that a new factory will bring some advantages to my
community. First of all, it will bring new job opportunities. Many specialists will be required
to work there. Second of all, I think many local community facilities will have to be
renovated to obtain reliable supply of water and electricity. So, some old pipes may be
changed. Another important benefit of this is that the local roads in order to manage the
increasing traffic will be rebuilt and widened.
However, I do not think that listed above benefits are worth all these troubles including
water contamination and the constant pollution of air. From my point of view all factories
must be built far from the people communities because they can be really harmful for
people's health.",human
111,1042,"New factories often bring many good things to a community, such as jobs and increased
prosperity. However, in my opinion, the benefits of having a factory are outweighed by the
risks. That is why I oppose the plan to build a factory near my community.
I believe that this city would be harmed by a large factory. In particular, a factory would
destroy the quality of the air and water in town. Factories bring smog and pollution. In the
long run, the environment will be hurt and people’s health will be affected. Having a
factory is not worth that rise.
Of course, more jobs will be created by the factory. Our population will grow. To
accommodate more workers, more homes and stores will be needed. Do we really want
this much growth, so fast? If our town is going in growth, I would prefer slow growth with
good planning. I don’t want to see rows of cheaply constructed townhouses. Our quality of
life must be considered.
I believe that this growth will change our city too much. I love my hometown because it is
a safe, small town. It is also easy to travel here. If we must expand to hold new citizens,
the small-town feel will be gone. I mould miss that greatly.
A factory would be helpful in some ways. However, I feel that the dangers are greater
than the benefits. I cannot support a plan to build a factory here, and hope that others feel
the same way.",human
112,105,"I think it is a great idea to build a new university in my community. However, I think it is a
controversial question whether the building of a new university will bring only benefits to
our community. In this essay I will analyze advantages and disadvantages of this issue
and present my view in favor of establishing a new university in my community.
From the one side, establishing a new university in my community brings many benefits.
First of all, a new construction means more job opportunities. I think it would be good for
my community because many people have to spend much time driving to their work day
in and day out because they could not find a job in our neighborhood. Second of all, a
new university is a good chance to meet new people and I like this opportunity. Many
students will live in our community. Finally, if a new university is built in my community
there is a big chance that I will be willing to enroll in it. I think it is great because it is not
far from my place and I do not have to move to another part of the city. Another important
aspect of this is that people from my community will have a chance to use new libraries
and facilities of a new university. For example some people can take courses and classes
there.
From the other side, building a new university can bring some disadvantages. A new
construction means noise, traffic jams and different kinds of pollution. In addition to these
disadvantages, many young people in our community can cause more noise especially in
the evenings.
To sum up, I think that I would support the decision of the government of establishing a
new university in my community despite a few disadvantages that could follow this
construction. I believe that a new university will increase a chance of many young people
to get a higher education, gain more knowledge and experience, which will help them to
succeed in today’s world.",human

historical buildings.
First of all, by preserving historical buildings we pass our history to our future generations.
I think that out children should know their history, learn from it and respect it. People need
to know their traditions and customs, which are priceless and irreplaceable. Our history is

Second of all, by preserving historical buildings a city can attract many travelers.
Welcoming tourists a city can get many benefits including money, which can be spent on
preserving historical buildings as well as on improving roads and facilities.
Also, many tourists mean a lot of new business opportunities. Another important aspect of
this is that businessmen will be willing to build new recreational centers, hotels, movie
theaters, shopping centers to make a city more attractive for travelers. In addition to those
practical benefits, many people will have the opportunity to get a job. All this is good for
the economy of the city.

114,107,"City has its architectural character, but the similarities between cities are more obvious
these days than in the past. In my opinion, one reason for this is the high price of land.
In most large cities, land is scarce and consequently it is very valuable. This has led to the
construction of tall buildings which occupy only a small area of land while providing lots of
floor space where people can live or work. Buildings of this type are made of concrete and
steel and can be built comparatively quickly using prefabricated materials. They do not
use local materials, such as stone, timber or brick, which used to give cities their
individual character. In consequence many cities. now look very much the same and you
might not know whether you were in Brisbane, Bangkok or Berlin when you are on the
street.
While I realise that we cannot stand in the way of progress, I believe that cities should try
to keep some individuality. For example, in Paris it is prohibited to build very tall buildings
in the centre of the city, as this would spoil the overall appearance of the skyline.
Other cities have chosen to design unique buildings to ensure they look different. The twin
towers in Kuala Lumpur or the Opera House in Sydney are examples of this approach,
and I agree with this kind of initiative.
All in all, although it is regrettable that modern cities look similar, I tend to feel that this is
unavoidable. However, it can be argued that, even if the buildings are similar, cities will
maintain their own character as a result of cultural diversity, the terrain and the climate,
which ultimately determine how people live.",human
115,108,"A public building is a building that belongs in some way o the state. The number of public

The desire to build impressive buildings is not new. The ancient cities of the Middle East

enemies and give a sense of pride. In modern times, outstanding public buildings still.
create a great sense of local and national pride. They are what gives a city its character

However, some people argue that governments have constructed unnecessary, and
sometimes ugly, buildings simply to make themselves feel important. I tend to feel that
such buildings may be a waste of public money but I am not sure we can claim that they
prevent houses from being built, because these governments have often ensured that
adequate housing was also available. Houses and public buildings can exist side by side.
The answer lies in finding ape right balance. We want to feel pride in our town, but we also
want our citizens to have comfortable homes. It is hard to please everyone.",human

However, others aspire to changes and new experience. Personally, for the several
reasons, which I will explain bellow, I prefer the first approach to life.
First of all, changes in one's life bring many benefits. One tries new things, gains new
knowledge and experience. I think it is great because without changes life becomes
boring. I always try to make changes in my life. Moreover, when I feel that my life is boring
I do not feel well about it. I feel like I spent those days for nothing. I did not do anything
exiting, I learnt nothing interesting and I just waisted my time.
Second of all, people need changes. Furthermore, we need obstacles to overcome and
reach our goals. I believe that changes make us stronger, more persistent, more selfconfident, and more patient. Also, I feel that all people who succeeded in life like changes
and new experience because it is impossible to be the best at some field without
perfecting the present knowledge and gain new experience. People catch every
opportunity to learn more and change their life for the best.
From the other side, people who like their lives to stay the same are very permanent.
They have the same job all their life, the same habits, the same week-ends and even the
same years in years out. I think it is boring. What will they tell their children about their
lives? What kind of contribution will they make for the society? I think such people are just
afraid of changes.

human evolution. People always wanted to break limits and gain more knowledge and
experience. So, people who enjoy change are the engine of human development.",human
118,111,"Man, through the ages, has undergone any changes from the time when he had to haunt
for food to these days when he has to buy it. Some people prefer to buy fresh vegetables,
meat and fruits and prepare food at home. However, other people prefer to skip that step
with cooking and have dinner at a restaurant. I think that both of these choices have some
advantages and disadvantages. Bellow I will give some reasons to support my answer.
Personally, I do not like fast food. So, my choice is always between a restaurant and my
home. First of all, I would like to say that cooking is a great tradition. It helps people to
relax, reflect on some pleasant moments while peeling or cutting the vegetables. It is a
means of eliminating one's stress and tension. Second of all, sometimes I do not want to
have something too complicated for my dinner. I just want to have light food like a salad
and a glass of milk. So, one of the reasons why I like to eat at home is because I can
have what I want at this moment. One greater thing about eating at home is that I can sit
in front of the TV and watch an interesting program or a movie. Finally, having dinner at
home allows a family communicates with each other, be closer and share some good and
bad moments that happened earlier that day. Besides, eating at home is a great way to
save some money.
As for restaurants, I see some positive aspects about eating there too. First of all, I
sometimes get tired from peeling, cutting, washing, frying, etc. It does not mean I do it a
lot. Sometimes I just use the microwave and a preprocessed food that I bought earlier. I
want to have something more delicious than I have in my refrigerator, something that is
time-consuming to prepare at home. So, for me it is a good reason to go to a restaurant.
There one may meet old friends or just has a great time listening to music and tasting
some delicious meats.
Also, restaurants are a good place to celebrate something. One does not have to prepare
food for all friends who are coming, wash dish, put in order all that mess after the party,
etc.

important is that it must be full and nutritious.",human
119,112,"It’s widely believed in today’s materialistic world that the latest innovative fashion trends
hold great significance. On the other hand, such trends are believed to be set only in the
pursuit of profits for large designer companies. It seems that in recent times, people are
now changing their minds in regards to wearing clothes for comfort and as a personal
choice. Personally I agree that we should pay more attention to individuality and comfort
in the way we dress.
Firstly, fashion designs exist as a form of creative artistic expression of the designer.
Although this may be true, undoubtedly such designs take away individuality once a trend
is set in place. By this I mean that there is nothing unique about wearing what everybody
else does. More specifically, if everyone sports the latest colour and design in summer
skirts, do we not look the same?
Secondly, It is possible that fashion trends can look extremely stylish to the general
public. However, it can be argued that the main purpose of wearing clothes is for more
functional reasons. This is primarily due to the fact that clothes were traditionally worn to
protect people from climatic conditions. For instance, clothes are still worn basically to
keep people warm and dry in winter and cool in summer.
Finally, fashion certainly gives us a sense of confidence and pride in our appearance.
While this is certainly a good point, it also means that following such changeable trends
proves to be expensive. For example, purchasing every latest season’s fashion item will
of course blow the budget of many young people.

lives have changed dramatically. In some ways life is worse, but mostly it is better.
Changes in food preparation methods, for example, have improved our lives greatly.
The convenience of preparing food today is amazing. Even stoves have gotten too slow
for us. Microwave cooking is much easier. We can press a few buttons and a meal is
completely cooked in just a short time. People used to spend hours preparing an ovencooked meal, and now they can use that time for other, better things. Plus, there are all
kinds of portable, prepackaged foods we can buy. Heat them in the office microwave, and
lunch at work is quick and easy.
Food preparation today allows for more variety. With refrigerators and freezers, we can
preserve a lot of different foods in our homes. Since technology makes cooking so much
faster, people are willing to make several dishes for even a small meal. Parents are more
likely to let children be picky, now that they can easily heat them up some prepackaged
macaroni and cheese on the side. Needless to say, adults living in the same house may
have very different eating habits as well. If they don’t want to cook a lot of different dishes,
it’s common now to eat out at restaurants several times a week.
Healthful eating is also easier than ever now. When people cook, they use new fat
substitutes and cooking sprays to cut fat and calories. This reduces the risk of heart
disease and high cholesterol. Additionally, we can buy fruits and vegetable fresh, frozen
or canned. They are easy to prepare, so many of us eat more of those nutritious items
daily. A hundred years ago, you couldn’t imagine the process of taking some frozen fruit
and ice from the freezer, adding some low-fat yogurt from a plastic cup and some juice
from a can in the refrigerator, and whipping up a low-fat smoothie in the blender!

made our lives better. Nowadays we can prepare meals much faster than we could in the

Microwave ovens have made it possible to prepare delicious food quickly. People these
days rarely have time to shop and prepare meals the old-fashioned way. We live very fast
lives. We are busy working, caring for our families travelling, playing sports, and many
other things. Because of microwave ovens, we have time to enjoy a good meal with our
family and then play soccer, go to a movie, study, or do anything else we want to afterwards.
Modern methods of preserving food have made it possible to enjoy a wide variety of food.
Because of refrigerators, freezers, canning, and freeze-drying, we can eat fruits and
vegetables that come from far away places. We can prepare a meal one day and save the
leftovers in the refrigerator or freezer to eat at another time. We can keep different kinds
of food in the refrigerator or on the shelf. Its easy to always have food available and to be
able to eat completely different meals every day.
Healthful eating is easier now than it ever was. Because of modern transportation
methods, fresh fruits and vegetables are available all year round. Modern kitchen
appliances make it easy to prepare fruits and vegetables fro cooking. Bread machines
make it possible to enjoy healthful, home-baked bread whenever we like. We can eat
fresh and healthful food everyday because modern methods have made preparation
easy.

breakthroughs that are changing the whole way we view the world on an almost daily

life, and we need to constantly adapt to keep pace with it.
Those people who believe they have achieved some security by doing the same, familiar
things are living in denial. Even when people believe they are resisting change
themselves, they cannot stop the world around them from changing. Sooner or later they
will find that the familiar jobs no longer exist, or that the ‘safe’ patterns of behaviour are

However, reaching the conclusion that change is inevitable is not the same as assuming
that ‘change is always for the better’. Unfortunately, it is not always the case that new
things are promoted because they have good impacts for the majority of people. A lot of
innovations are made with the aim of making money for a few. This is because it is the
rich and powerful people in our society who are able to impose changes (such as in
working conditions or property developments) that are in their own interests.

123,115,"Every four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the
Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to
make their country proud of them. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in
easing international tensions in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control
the world's economy and other governments were fighting over land.
The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can
bring nations together, at least temporarily. From ancient History, when Greeks and
Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent
international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their
differences, compete pacifically and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover,
these popular events have called the world's attention to the terrible consequences of
wars; thus some leaders have tried to accept agreements to end their dispute and live
peacefully.
Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which
live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack
of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense
embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football
World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world,
provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their
problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national
colors, use wear the Brazilian team shirt and buy national flags. Moreover, the
competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games
and celebrate peacefully.
In conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international
tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as History has shown.",human
124,1151,"Millions of people play sport every day, and, inevitably, some suffer injury or pain. Most
players and spectators accept this risk. However, some people would like to see
dangerous sports such as boxing banned. This essay will examine some of the reasons
for banning certain sports.
Some sports are nothing but an excuse for violence. Boxing is a perfect example. The last
thing an increasingly violent world needs is more violence on our television. The sight of
two men (or even women) bleeding, with faces ripped open, trying to obliterate each other
is barbaric. Other sports, such as American football or rugby, are also barely-concealed
violence.
Some people argue that the players can choose to participate. However this is not always
the case. Many boxers, for example, come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are
lured by money or by social or peer pressure and then cannot escape. Even in richer
social groups, schools force unwilling students to play aggressive team sports, claiming
that playing will improve the students' character (or the school's reputation), but in fact
increasing the risk of injury.
Even where people can choose, they sometimes need to be protected against
themselves. Most people approve of governments' efforts to reduce smoking. In the same
way, governments need to act if there are unacceptably high levels of injuries in sports
such as football, diving, mountaineering, or motor-racing.
I accept that all sports involve challenge and risk. However violence and aggression
should not be permitted in the name of sport. Governments and individuals must act to
limit brutality and violence, so that children and adults can enjoy and benefit from sport.",human
125,116,"Today, many sports are becoming increasingly regulated. Boxing, rugby, soccer, and
other games are being targeted by sports bodies and medical organizations in an effort to
improve safety standards and to reduce injuries. However, for some people, this is not
enough, and they would rather see some dangerous sports banned completely. In this
essay, I will examine some arguments against banning dangerous sports.
Sports, competition, and games seem to be natural to humans. Young children learn their
own limits and strengths through play with others, but they also learn valuable social
lessons about what acceptable behavior and the rights of others. Sport therefore is not
just a physical phenomenon, but a mental and social one.
Challenging sport provides a healthy, largely safe, physical outlet for aggression. There is
very little evidence to show that people who take part in dangerous sports become violent
as a result. In fact it is more likely that apart from the many friendships created in playing,
sport acts as a safety valve for a society by reducing stress. Moreover, sport teaches and
requires discipline, training, and respect for the rules - valuable lessons in any society.
Almost all sports involve some risk. Young rugby players are paralysed every year in
scrums. Scuba-diving accidents can lead to brain damage or death. Even golf or jogging
can lead to pain or injury. Without some elements of risk or challenge, sport becomes
meaningless. A marathon runner trying to improve his time, basketball players fiercely
battling an opposing team, or a sky-diving team defying gravity - all are trying to push
themselves to their maximum. There is therefore no sport without danger.
There is also the issue of freedom. Without a wide range of sports, many people would
feel trapped or limited. People should be free to participate in activities with others as long
as it does not affect the safety of non-participants.
There also should be limits to the power of governments to ban sports. If one sport is
banned because of alleged danger, then what sport would be next? Boxing is the most
common target of opponents of dangerous sports. But if boxing is banned, would motor
racing follow, then rugby, wrestling, or weightlifting? Furthermore, many sports would go
underground, leading to increased injury and illegal gambling.
Nobody denies that regulation is needed. Medical bodies have introduced safety rules in
boxing, in soccer, and these safety regulations have been welcomed by players. But the
role of government should be reduced.
In conclusion, our society would be healthier if more people took part in sports of all kinds.
We should continue to try to prevent accidents and injuries. However, we should also
ensure that sports are challenging, exciting, and, above all, fun.",human

has been the discovery of the outer space. Russia is the first country that launched a
spacecraft with a man on the board into the space. This event was a big step towards the
new discoveries and brought many benefits not only for people in my country. Bellow I will
give my reasons to support my answer.
First of all, all humankind made a huge step towards the mystery of our creation.
Scientists had the opportunity to do the new research and experiments. Many new
discoveries were made on the boards of the spacecrafts in the outer space. People from
all over the world watched these events. Many books with real colorful photos were
written about the beginning of the space exploration. Nowadays we have a big station
called ""Mir"" in the outer space created on the base of collaboration USA and Russia.
Many people work there doing amazing experiments.
Second of all, the world became ""smaller"". People learnt how to exchange information
very quickly by use of satellites. Television is broad-casted all over the world by use of
satellites. Here in Houston I can watch Russian programs. People got the opportunity to
exchange news very quickly.
To sum up, I believe that space exploration will bring much more benefits in the future and
someday we will learn what is beyond our current galaxy.",human

herd of mammoths on the walls of his cave to these days when he can create beautiful
pictures and even make coffee by use of computer technologies without leaving his
favorite chair. The 20th century made huge steps in developing computer technologies
and reached many goals that made our life much easier. What should we expect in the
21st century?
First of all, I think that the pace of our life will speed up: we will move faster from one
place to another, from one continent to another using high speed jet airplanes. Second of
all, I believe that we will be able to do many things that take much time now without
leaving our house. Computers will be everywhere including out clothes. Many people will
have chips and mini computers inserted in their heads to hold huge amount of information
and have a quick access to it.
But what will be the most amazing thing in the 21st century is the flights to the outer
space and Mars that will be available to all people. Scientists say that Mars has many
things similar to the Earth's. Moreover, they say that with the help of modern technology
people can artificially create conditions that will allow people to live there on the constant
basis.
To sum up, I am sure that many amazing changes will be brought by the 21st century.
Furthermore, I think that with the help of the contemporary technologies people can do
many things that were even difficult to imagine a century ago. So, nowadays it is rather
difficult and even impossible to imagine all changes that will happen in the next decades.",human
128,119,"For over fifty years, a number of nations have been involved in the exploration of outer
space. This research has been very costly, of course. Has this money been well-spent or
wasted?
Some people believe that all or most space research should be eliminated because of its
incredible expense, not only in terms of money, but also in terms of scientific and human
resources. These people point out the fact that it cost billions of dollars to send astronauts
to the moon, but all they brought back were some worthless rocks. These people say that
the money and effort now being wasted in outer space could be spent for homeless
people, improving the education system, saving the environment, and finding cures for
diseases.
However, other people believe that space research has provided many benefits to
mankind. They point out that hundreds of useful products, from personal computers to
heart pacemakers to freeze-dried foods, are the direct or indirect results of space
research. They say that weather and communication satellites, which are also products of
space programs, have benefited people all over the globe. In addition to these practical
benefits, supporters of the space program point to the scientific knowledge that has been
acquired about the sun, the moon, the planets and even our own earth as a result of
space research.
I agree with those people who support space research and want it to continue. Space
research, as shown, has already brought many benefits to humanity. Perhaps it will bring
even more benefits in the future, ones that we can not even imagine now. Moreover, just
as individual people need challenges to make their lives more interesting, I believe the
human race itself needs a challenge, and I think that the peaceful exploration of outer
space provides just such a challenge.",human
129,120,"Holidays are important because they provide a break from our normal daily routine and
from the world of work. Traditionally, holidays have been seen as a time for relaxation and
as an opportunity to visit another country in order to find out about its geography and
customs. Nowadays, however, it seems that other types of holiday are becoming popular.
Some people want their holiday to be a kind of adventure, and find this more exciting than
going to the beach or visiting museums. On an adventure holiday, you may stay in quite
basic accommodation, rather than a luxurious hotel. Activities may involve things such as
bush walking or cycling, or may form part of an aid project designed to help communities
in remote areas. Holidays such as these are popular with people of all ages and can often
help to promote tourism in rural environments.
The increasing popularity of dangerous sports has also boosted the number of adventure
holidays; for example, water sports, mountain climbing or paragliding. These holidays are
more popular with the younger generation, as they can be both physically and mentally
demanding. Participants are often seeking the sort of thrills that they cannot get in
ordinary life.
There is now greater awareness of the damaging effects of mass tourism and this may be
one reason for the changing nature of holidays. This can only be a good thing. But
perhaps people are also discovering that it is just as refreshing to take an active holiday,
as it is to lie on a beach - though that is still a question of personal preference.",human
130,121,"I am a person who likes to travel. I think traveling is a great opportunity to meet new
people, gain more knowledge and experience, and learn new customs and traditions. I did
not travel a lot yet, but I am sure I will have a chance to do it. So, if I had the opportunity
to visit a foreign country I would visit Egypt. I think it is a great and very interesting country
with marvellous history. In the following paragraphs I will give some reasons to support
my choice.
First of all, I always dreamed to visit Egypt pyramids. My aunt visited Egypt a few years
ago. She was very excited after that trip and said that she would return there one more
time at any cost. She said that Egypt had impressed her very much with its glorious
pyramids and ancient buildings. Second of all, I think that in that country one can touch
history, feel the hard breath of workers building a pyramid under the parching sun, and
see the chain of camels walking in the desert with the huge trunks full of presents for
Cleopatra on their humps. Finally, I want to see a real dessert and ride the camel. All my
friends who rode the camel say that it is an unforgettable experience.
I believe that I will have a chance to visit this beautiful country someday. Unfortunately,
now I have plenty of plans and things to do, so, I am afraid that I will not be able to travel
for the next two years. I want to finish my education and then find a job, and these things
have higher priority then traveling. My husband wants to visit this country too and we
made an agreement to make our trip to Egypt on our five years anniversary which is in
two years.
In conclusion, I want to add that after my trip to Egypt I will definitely visit Australia. This
country is the second one on my list the most wanted to see.",human
131,122,"The growth of tourism and the numbers of people travelling to other countries for their
vacations has led to debate as to whether this is beneficial. I believe that there are many
problems which arise out of the tourist industry, and will examine these in detail.
Many people argue that travel broadens the mind. However, this statement does not fully
hold water. I would argue that spending a few weeks in another country is not long
enough to gain a proper understanding of an alien culture. A foreigner visiting Britain
might be met with the traditional British reserve, and mistakenly conclude that the British
are unfriendly. Furthermore, some people are unwilling to open their minds. A Western
traveller to an Arab country is unlikely to consider that the veiling of women is acceptable.
Being a tourist in a foreign country brings with it problems that can lead to dislike of the
native people. Firstly, a foreigner is vulnerable, and is often ripped off by locals. Secondly,
the language barrier can lead to misunderstandings. Thirdly, tourists are often hassled to
buy goods, which can ruin a holiday. When I went to Bali, people tried to sell me
something every five minutes, and this totally spoilt my sunbathing.
Local people also often end up disliking foreigners. Visitors may mistakenly act contrary to
local norms, or they may just be plain offensive, as many drunken British holidaymakers
must seem to the Spanish. Global tourism can lead to hostility from the native people,
who may feel their traditional way of life is under threat. Additionally, the relative wealth of
the foreign visitors can cause envy and resentment.
In conclusion, I would say that I largely agree with the argument that global tourism
creates misunderstanding between people from different cultures, and that the differences
are often a cause for conflict rather than celebration.",human
132,123,"The issue whether working for a large company is better than working for a small
company is a controversial one. From my everyday experience and observation I think
that every option has its advantages and disadvantages. I base my opinion on the
following points.
From the one side working for a large company brings many benefits. First of all, one has
better medical insurance, higher salary. Often employees of a large company have less
responsibility. Moreover, they feel more secure because their company has more clients
and this means better chance to survive on the modern market. However, one working for
a large company has less chance to be promoted because one's manager does not want
to lose his or her job unless she or he is promoted too. Also, from my observation,
managers of a large company do not pay much attention to one's solutions and
suggestions.
From the other side working for a small company has many advantages too. Firstly, one
has better chance to be promoted. Secondly, one can talk to the owner of the company
about any improvements that can be done in order to get more profit. Another important
aspect of working for a small company is the opportunities to find out more about how
company works. As a result of this one can gain more experience and get better
recommendations. However, this also has some disadvantages. For instance, one can
get less salary, worse medical benefits, etc.
To sum up, I think that every person chooses for himself what he or she wants. If one
wants better career and more responsibilities then a small company is better choice.
Otherwise, working for a large company may be a good option too.",human
133,124,"A large number of people spend most of their time at work. Our life is divided into three
equal parts: 8 hours - sleep, 8 hours - work, 8 hours - family time. So, in the most cases,
one's co-worker plays an important role in one's life. From my opinion, the essential
characteristics of a co-worker are the following.
First of all, a person who works closely with me must like his job. I think it is very important
for a person to feel satisfaction with his job. My husband is a software developer. He is
fond of his job and people enjoy working with him because they see how many energy he
puts into his job.
Second of all, my co-worker must be persistent and never give up. I like when people who
came across a problem try to solve it, find a good decision instead of looking for another
person to hand it over. Another important aspect of this is that a good worker should
always ask himself ""What can be improved?"" and suggests new solutions.
In addition, he must be a good team player. In the modern world good communication
skills and the ability to work in a team are among the common position requirements.
Personally, I think it is great to help each other, share new ideas, develop new solutions,
etc. It helps to create a team spirit and improve labor productivity.
Finally, my co-worker must be punctual. He or she should finish the job on time I think that
It is unacceptable to make the rest of a team wait while a person finishes his or her job.
Also, my ""ideal co-worker"" should always be ready to offer his or her help and be
supportive.
To summarize, I think if a co-worker possesses all of these qualities mentioned above he
can make work with him really enjoyable and productive.",human
134,125,"Many people have to work under somebody's supervision. 
In most cases an employee does not choose his or her boss, unless a supervisor is elected. 
In the following paragraphs I will list the most important qualities of my ""ideal boss"".
First of all, he must be impartial. I believe that it is very important to make a technical
decision, think about somebody's promotion, etc. impartially. For instance, my friend is a
supervisor on a dairy mill. It is his family's business so a lot of his relatives work there. But
he never promotes someone because he or she is his family. I think it is a good quality for
a boss.
Second of all, my ""ideal boss"" must be honest, patient and attentive. He should pay
attention to people's feelings, encourage them by increasing their salary, listen to their
suggestions about improving labor conditions and productivity. For instance, if he does
not satisfied with the result he should understand the origin of the problem and explain
people how to fix it. In addition, he must know how to solve conflicts that can arise
between employees.
Another important quality of a boss is the ability to choose the right decisions and to learn
on somebody's mistakes.
Finally, I think a good boss must value his or her employees because the profit directly
depends on the people who work there.
In conclusion, I think a good boss should be able to make his people enjoy the work they
are doing and encourage their diligence.",human
135,126,"I would have to completely disagree with the statement above. In the following
paragraphs I will outline the basic concepts of my position.
First of all, I will least the major disadvantages for employers. On the today's market a
company must be very flexible in order to compete with other firms. So, imagine the
situation when a company can not fire its employees to stay on the market. It will lead to
loosing not only a profit, but the clients, market share and competitive ability. Now,
imagine the situation when a company is growing fast, everything is good and the next
few years are going to be excellent. So, employers need more people to extend the
production. However, nobody can tell what will happen in a few years. In this case,
employers will be afraid to hire new people and extend their business because they will
not be able to fire them if something goes wrong. Another important aspect of this is that a
company can not have the best employees. It can not hire the better one without
dismissing another employee.
What kind of disadvantages will have an employee in exchange for this kind of job
security? First of all, it will be very difficult to find a job if one is not the best, because an
employer does not want to spend money on one's education. Besides, employer will not
have a chance to fire one if he does not do his job well. Second of all, employees with this
kind of security tend not to perfect themselves because after they are hired they can not
lose their job.
In conclusion, I would like to add that this statement has some positive aspects too such
as constancy, a strong spirit of the company, etc. This system takes place in Japan and
some companies succeeded in it. But I think that the reason of it subsists in the Japanese
traditions, the particular cultural features, habits and customs. However, on today's
market here in the United States a company can not afford to hire employees for their
entire life.",human
136,127,"Form my everyday experience and observation I think that all people who succeeded in
life had to work hard and gain more knowledge and experience in order to reach their
goals. From the other hand, people who all their life do things they already do well and do
not improve their knowledge do not move forward. I base my statement on the following
points.
First of all, people who want to succeed must constantly improve their knowledge and
gain more experience. Moreover, they must be the best at their profession. So, they need
to try new things, take risks sometimes and work hard.
Second of all, it is impossible to live without trying new things. Imagine one wants to learn
how to drive. He will never be able to do it without learning new things such as driving rules. 
Personally, I think that it is very interesting to learn new, to gain more experience, to make
new goals and reach them. Life is too short to stay on one place. People need changes
because they make our lives more beautiful and exiting. We find out new things, learn
new things and dream to know other things. People need challenges because while
overcoming obstacles we make new discoveries, become stronger, perfect ourselves and
move forward.
To sum up, I believe that people's aspiration for learning new things is the main reason
the way we live now. People make many discoveries and inventions that make our lives
easier, happier and longer.",human
137,128,"I totally disagree with the idea of high-level employees leaving at the age of 55 to make
room for the upcoming generation. While it is true that the energy level and fresh ideas of
youth can rejuvenate a company, the steady hand of experience can still best guide a
company in most cases.
In English there is a saying, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” In the fast-paced
world of business, bolstered by even faster hi-tech innovations, a younger more pliant
mind would seem to be able to adapt with greater flexibility, while such an environment
might boggle an older more set-in-its-ways mind. Take, for example, Microsoft’s Bill
Gates, whose energy and brilliant insights as a youth helped him to pioneer new territory
in the computer software world and establish a digital empire. Now as a more mature
CEO, this king of the “computer” mountain is constantly on the verge of being knocked
down by upcoming digeratti entrepreneurs. However, it is now the experience he has
accumulated as an older man which keeps him on top. So, combining the vigour and
innovation of younger workers with the experience of older workers would seem to be the
winning hand in the world of business.
The assertion is to give opportunities to the younger generation. If everyone retires at 55,
there will be smaller pool of experience at the company. So, who will show them the ropes
of the trade? It would be as if we lopped off the last few chapters of a textbook. On this
point the argument would seem to be built on false presumptions.
And think of all the other problems retirement at 55 would create. With life expectancy in
many advanced nations at 70-plus years, how would the state along with private
enterprises be able to support their retirement pensions? The economic repercussions of
such an idea could be great.
Besides, the Western form of capitalism is built on competition and merit and not seniority
according to age, and democracy is built on equality for all regardless of one’s age, so the
argument clearly goes against these two pillars of Western society.
Granted, my counter-arguments are perhaps as simplistic as the original assertion itself,
but without qualifying the assertion with greater supporting evidence or background
information, both sides can be argued. Nevertheless, even after thoroughly considering
the argument, I believe I would still adhere to my viewpoint that the assertion lacks merit
for the aforementioned reasons. Besides, when I am 55 I do not fancy the idea of being
put out to pasture. I think I will still be full of vitality and have a desire to work, so I hope
my workplace will view me as a treasure house of valuable experience to pass along to
the next generation and keep me on until I am at least 65 if not older.",human
138,129,"Mandatory retirement age varies from society to society, perhaps a reflection of
economics, population pressures or simply value systems. Indeed, retirement at 50 can
probably be as easily justified as that at 70. It is my belief, however, that the longer an
able person is allowed to work, the better for both the individual worker and the employer.
Chronological age is not always a true indicator of ability. While some 65¬ year-olds may
not perform as well as they did in their past, many workers at this age do just as well or
better than they used to. People's suitability for a position should be a reflection of their
performance in the job, rather than the number of wrinkles or grey hairs they have.
Employers concerned about the increasing age of their employees need only observe
their work records. Those doing poorly may be asked to retire, but those as yet unaffected
by age should stay on. Indeed, it would appear economical for an organisation to retain its
older employees when possible rather than spend time and money on training new
workers.
Remaining in one's job for as long as one is able makes sense as life expectancies
increase around the world. As people live longer, they are longer able to contribute to
society in the form of meaningful work. But they are also in need of income for a longer
period, so a mandatory retirement age of 55 for someone who is statistically likely to live
to 77 becomes increasingly difficult to justify. At a time when populations are ageing,
governments are less able to provide for their senior citizens, so by keeping able workers
in paid employment for as long as is practicable, public expenditures are less strained.
Thus, workers who can still demonstrate their capacity to carry out their work should not
be asked to retire simply because they have reached a certain age. Societies that insist
on early retirement may do well to look again at their policies.",human
139,130,"Many old people work well into their 70s and 80s, running families, countries or
corporations. Other people, however, despite being fit and highly talented, are forced to
retire in their or even earlier because of company or national regulations. This essay will
examine whether people should be allowed to continue working for as long as they want
or whether they should be encouraged to retire at a particular stage.
There are several arguments for allowing older people to continue working as long as
they are able. First of all, older employees have an immense amount of knowledge and
experience which can be lost to a business or organization if they are made to retire. A
second point is that older employees are often extremely loyal employees and are more
willing to implement company policies than younger less committed staff. However, a
more important point is regarding the attitudes in society to old people. To force someone
to resign or retire at 60 or 65 indicates that the society does not value the input of these
people and that effectively their useful life is over.
Allowing older people to work indefinitely however is not always a good policy. Age alone
is no guarantee of ability. Many younger employees have more experience or skills than
older staff, who may have been stuck in one area or unit for most of their working lives.
Having compulsory retirement allows new ideas in an organization. In addition, without
age limits, however arbitrary, many people would continue to work purely because they
did not have any other plans or roles. A third point of view is that older people should be
rewarded by society for their life’s labor by being given generous pensions and the
freedom to enjoy their leisure.
With many young people unemployed or frustrated in low-level positions, there are often
calls to compulsorily retire older workers. However, this can affect the older individual’s
freedom - and right - to work and can deprive society of valuable experience and insights.
I feel that giving workers more flexibility and choice over their retirement age will benefit
society and the individual.",human
140,131,"Over the past few decades, there have been many advances in medical
technology. Because of this, senior citizens are healthier and more active than before and
may choose to work beyond the age of 65. Nowadays, however, there has been a
growing debate as to whether or not these people should retire in order to create jobs for
the younger generation. Despite the advantages of early retirement, I strongly believe that
it is better for senior workers to continue working as long as they are physically and
mentally capable.
Those who believe that senior workers need to retire for younger generation base their
case on the following arguments. First, the unemployment rate, especially for college
graduates, has never been so high so it is today. This is largely due to the slow economy.
Therefore, firing some elderly workers who are well-paid would allow those unemployed
young people to have good opportunities to get a job. In addition, replacing older workers
with young people would bring greater benefits to companies [=employers]. This is
because youngsters are better at adapting themselves to fast changing information based
society. They are generally better at computers and speaking foreign languages than their
older counterparts.
Nevertheless, people should not ignore the fact that senior citizens have been playing
vital roles both at home and at work for their entire lives. To begin with, a young person's
need for a job is no more important than an older person's. Both have a responsibility to
support their families. Sadly, few seniors can afford early retirement. Besides, senior
workers provide the wisdom and experience that young employees cannot offer. There is
strong [=acute] possibility of situations arising that require the knowledge of skilled senior
employees.
In summary, the advantages of keeping seasoned workers far outweigh its
disadvantages. There are high hopes that employers exercise wisdom [=caution] in
dealing with this issue.",human
141,132,"The salaries of many singers, dancers and sports people have increased out of all
proportion in recent years, while in places like Sudan people are starving to death. I do
not beleive that anyone should be able to earn such enormous salaries whan so many
people in the world are living in poverty.
One af the factors which should affect what a person can earn ought to be the benefit of
person's work to society. It is unreasonable for a famous singer to be able to earn far
more from an evening's entertainment than, for instance, a medical scientist who
develops a new drug which produces a treatment for a common disease. The pop star
certainly has a value in society, but the value in no way exceeds, or even matches, the
value gained from a successful medication.
Secondly. work done should be paid according to the amount of effort and skill that goes
into it. Nobody would deny that a famous person works hard and is skillful, yet such
people do not work any harder than thousand of other workers who have no claim to
fame. Yet market force are such that these superstarts can obtain millions of dolor while
other unknown people sometimes earn less than they need to survive.
Finally, it should be possible for governments to work together to ensure that the amount
of money in circulation should be more more equally and fairly distributed. This seems
only fair given that there are so many suffering.
To conclude, it is clear that world poverty is a serious problem and yet the problem could
be eased if governments and compenies gave more thought to paying salaries on a more
equitable basis and if they started to contribute more money to those in need.",human
142,133,"In modern society, especially in big cities, undoubtedly hard work has become a very
important feature of ordinary people’s everyday life. It seems that many people are under
the impression that their work is becoming more pressing and urgent, and thus they
sacrifice more and more leisure time.
In the first place, with the rapid development of science and technology, work today is
more demanding than it used to be. For example, college graduates nowadays have to
master English, computer science and driving skills before they can find decent jobs.
People have to spend more time acquiring new techniques and skills. And their spare
time tends to be fully occupied, not with leisure pursuit, but with work-related pursuits.
In the second place, competition is becoming more intense. Many people feel anxious
that they may be “laid-off” if they can’t work as hard as others. And they also feel at a
disadvantage before new graduates. Therefore, it is understandable that people keep
themselves involved in intensely hard work in order to preserve their positions.
In my opinion, the worst aspect of this phenomenon is that the huge pressure of work will
gradually affect people’s mental health. Excessively hard work means that people can
never get rid of the fatigue of their work, even in their leisure time. This means that they
can not enjoy a normal life.
In a word, in modern society overwork is stealing our leisure time. however, I believe this
problem will be settled eventually with the development of science and technology.",human
143,134,"In the modern workplace there is no longer the attitude that ‘a job is for life’. Nowadays,
many people take the option to change jobs, while others prefer not to. In my essay, I will
explore the good and bad points of the above attitudes.
One of the main benefits of staying in one job is security. Changing employer often means
a period of instability, where one may have to think about moving house, or temporarily
losing a steady source of income. Staying in one job means these problems are avoided.
Another benefit of not changing occupation is that one is able to gain a lot of experience
and expertise in his specific profession, thus enhancing job security. One’s company may
recognize their loyalty and reward their service. On the other hand, those who often
change jobs may be seen as unreliable, lacking in experience and employers might be
reluctant to hire and invest training in them.
However, there are arguments in favour of changing job frequently. One is that a worker
improves his employability. Working in several different jobs often means that the
individual has more skills. Such people are seen as more dynamic and versatile.
Another benefit of changing jobs frequently is that one never gets stuck in a rut. From my
own experience, I got bored when I spent too long in a job. Following this, the quality of
my work would suffer. I also believe that employers generally don’t tend to greatly reward
loyalty or commitment. Increased wages and promotion are often easier to attain by
changing jobs.
Overall, it can be said that the disadvantages of changing jobs are the advantages of
staying put, and vice versa... In my opinion, I feel that changing jobs every once in a while
is of more benefit.",human
144,135,"Families who do not send their children to government-financed school should not be
required to pay taxes that support universal education.
When families send their children to non-public (that is, parochial and private) schools,
they must pay tuition and other school expenses. Spending additional money to pay taxes
creates an even greater financial hardship for these families. They must make sacrifices,
trying to have enough money to pay for school in addition to other bills. For example, my
friend Amalia is a single mother with an eight-year-old son, Andrew. Because they survive
solely on her income, money is tight. Amalia works at least 10 hours of overtime each
week to cover Andrew's school expenses. This gives Amalia and Andrew less time to
spend together, and she is always so tired that she is impatient with him when they do
have family time. Clearly, this extra expense is an unfair burden for hard-working parents
like Amalia.
While some people may consider parochial or private school to be a luxury, for many
families it is essential because their community's public schools fail to meet their
children's needs. Unfortunately, due to shrinking budgets, many schools lack wellqualified, experienced educators. Children may be taught by someone who is not a
certified teacher or who knows little about the subject matter. Some problems are even
more serious. For example, the public high school in my old neighborhood/neighbourhood
had serious safety problems, due to students bringing guns, drugs, and alcohol to school.
After a gang-related shooting occurred at the high school, my parents felt that they had no
choice but to enroll me in a parochial school that was known for being very safe.
Unfortunately, even when families prefer public schools, sometimes they can't send their
children to one. These families are burdened not only for paying expenses at another
school, but also by being forced to pay taxes to support a public school that they do not
use.",human
145,137,"While medical care and education are perhaps the highest causes to which money can be contributed, the
arts and athletics are in some ways just as valuable. So, to ask the government to not
extend support to these two areas could be just as detrimental to the welfare of society as
the lack of sufficient health care and education.
The Romans believed in “mens sana in corpore sano”. In short, that there is indeed a
correlation between a healthy body and healthy mind. When we are healthy, we feel
better and so are more likely to be productive academically. Plus, the practice of sports
can also teach us the very same discipline we need for our studies. Why even a brisk
walk or watching an exciting athletic match can refresh the mind for greater work.
Moreover, sports can serve to create healthier bodies, which in turn would serve as a
form of “preventive medicine” thereby cutting down on medical costs. In the same vein,
the arts are known to induce a sense of well-being in performers and audience alike,
reducing mental problems and their associated physical manifestations and again,
medical costs. As such, building theatres and stadiums, which spur interest in the arts and
sports respectively, actually would be practically identical to spending money on medical
care and education!
Now I realize the question specifically addresses the building of theatres and sports
stadiums by government. Some people would contend athletics and the arts can still be
enjoyed and practiced without such constructions. I would hazard that these buildings
stand as the altars to the sports and arts worlds, inspiring would-be athletes and
performers. Without such venues where would sports spectators and music aficionados
be able to enjoy these events? Now some other people would also say business could
support their construction, but we know the avarice of business could very likely
jeopardize the lofty spirit of athletics and the arts just as well. Therefore, allowing
government to retain some say in the matter on behalf of the people would, I believe, be
in the best interest of the people.
In short, as long as the government does no go overboard in its expenditures for these
buildings and uses such venues for the benefit of all, then, as mentioned above, people
will benefit in terms of both medical care and education as well. This is not to say the
government should neglect medical care and education, but rather to think of this not as
an either-or choice but as a win-win situation for all.",human
146,136,"Families who do not send their children to public school should be required to pay taxes
that support public education.
Every child in my country is required to attend school and every child is welcome to enroll
at his/her local public school. Some families choose to send their children to other
schools, and it is their prerogative to do so. However, the public schools are used by the
majority of our children and must remain open for everyone. For example, my uncle sent
his two children to a private academy for primary school. Then he lost a huge amount of
money through some poor investments and he could no longer afford the private school's
tuition. The children easily transferred to their local public school and liked it even more
than their academy. The public schools supported their family when they had no money to
educate their children.
Because the public schools educate so many citizens, everyone in my country-whether a
parent or not-should pay taxes to support our educational system. We all benefit from the
education that students receive in public school. Our future doctors, fire fighters, and
teacherspeople whom we rely on everyday-are educated in local public schools. When a
person is in trouble, it's reassuring to know that those who will help you-such as fire
fighters-know what they're doing because they received good training in school and later.
Providing an excellent education in the public school system is vital to the strength of our
community and our country.
Our government must offer the best education available, but it can only do so with the
financial assistance of all its citizens. Therefore, everyone-including families who do not
send their children to public school-should support public education by paying taxes. ",human
147,138,"A much debated issue these days is whether citizens should take out private health
insurance or not. The cost of providing free medical care for both the wealthy and the
poor is far too great for any government, and most people agree that if you can pay for
insurance, you should. In this essay, I will argue that all who can afford it should be
insured, but free medical care must be made available for those too poor to do so.
The most important reason for encouraging people to take out private health insurance is
the cost to the government of health care. Free health cover for people who are able to
pay for it is a waste of public money. Of course, people will only pay health insurance
premiums if they know that they are getting good value for their money. If they get sick,
they should pay very little or nothing at all. In addition, the privately insured are entitled to
special benefits such as having the choice of their own doctors, and being able to avoid
long waiting lists for hospital beds.

On the other hand, those who really cannot afford to pay private insurance premiums,
which are often very high, are still entitled as citizens to the best medical care available –
they cannot be expected to pay their own medical bills. However, if they are working, they
should still pay a percentage of their wage (say 1 to 2%) as a tax which pays towards the
cost of providing ""free"" medical services.
In conclusion, most people should privately insure their health, but it is unreasonable to
suppose that all citizens can afford it. Therefore, a safety net in the form of a basic free
health care system must exist for the very poor and the unemployed.",human
148,139,"Different countries have different education systems. I don‛t know all the education
systems in the world but all the ones I do know about have free school education at
primary and secondary level. I certainly agree with the statement that this should be the
case. I believe university education is different.
No matter what standard of income someone has or what society someone comes from,
everyone should have the opportunity to have a good standard of education. This is not
always what happens but it is what should happen. Private schools can be available for
those who want and can afford it but the free schools should always be there. This is
certainly one of the best attributes of western democracy and all countries it seems strive
to attain situation although some have problems due to the economic and political
situations in their countries. Governments should make sure that all their citizens have
access to a good standard of free education at primary and secondary level.
Further education is different. In an ideal world this should be free but governments have
a lot of demands on their money. I think that students should have to pay, maybe not all,
but at least a contribution towards their tuition fees. They will be able to earn it back once
they have graduated. The UK has this system whereas in the US students have to pay all
their high tuition fees which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars over a full
course. I am not sure if I agree with this but it certainly would make sure that students
make the best of efforts to pass or all their money would be wasted.
Therefore I conclude that primary and secondary education should be freely available for
all if possible but that further education should not necessarily be wholly free.",human
149,140,"There are some conditions under which a novelist could reasonably expect some
government suport. In general terms, if the writer has already proved that he or she can
write well, and if the stories produced are stimulating and interesting, then I consider that
some financial help might be given.
Language quality is difficult to define, but if the writing shows, for example, good
grammar, a wide vocabulary, and elegance and imagination, then I can see a valid reason
for assisting an author to spend some time free from money problems. Such a writing
needs to be encouraged. the entertainment value of a book would be also a factor in
deciding whether to provide assistance to an author. Further consideration would include
social and educational values expressed in the author's work.
However, if the ideas were socially irresponsible, or if the stories contain unnecessary
violence or pornography for its own sake, then I would not want to see the author
sponsored to write stories which do not benefit society. Other exceptions are the many
writers of good books who do not require financial help. Books which proved to be
extremely popular, such as the Harry Potter stories, clearly need no subsidy at all
because the authors have become rich through their writing.
Views on what good quality writing means will vary widely, and so if any author is to be
given money for writing, then the decision would have to be made by a committee or
panel of judge. An individual opinion would certainly cause disagreement among the

151,1421,"Art is a basic human need. Governments have a responsibility to spend money on art for
their citizens. (Shorter version: 260 words)
Many people's lives are richer because of art - music, paintings, calligraphy, pictures,
sculpture, poems and dance. However, some people feel that governments should be
spending money on housing, medical care, or defence, instead of on art. This essay will
discuss whether governments should or should not spend money on the arts.
There are several reasons why governments should not finance artists. First of all,
artists should have to follow the same rules as the rest of the market. If there is a demand
for their music or sculpture, then they will be rich. Secondly, politicians generally do not
have good taste. They will waste public money on popular art or on their own preferences.
But the main reason why governments should minimize spending on the art world
is that there are more important areas like housing, roads, hospitals, and factories which
need the money first.
However, it would be wrong to say that governments should not spend any money at
all on art. Everybody needs some beauty in their life, but not everyone can afford a
Picasso or a piece of music. Governments should provide money for museums or concert
halls for everyone. Another point is that art allows people to express themselves and
this is good for society, culture and thought. Thirdly, artists can be good for the economy
by producing music, films, and attracting tourists.
All in all, governments should prioritize their spending carefully, but they should also
allocate some of their budget for art. It is part of their duty to society and to future
generations.",human
152,1422,"Throughout the ages, man has tried to create beauty through painting, music, sculpture
and other artistic expression. It seems to be a basic need of humans to surround
themselves with art. However some people feel that government money spent on art is
wasted, particularly when there are so many other demands on it. This essay will examine
the conflict between those who say art is important and those who feel it is a waste of
money.
It can be wrong for governments to spend large sums of money on art. Too often,
governments spend unwisely. They spend money on art not because a picture is good or
a museum is needed, but for political reasons. Cities end up with huge statues or empty
expensive buildings that are used only by a few people or the elite. Another point is that
the artworks are often chosen to represent social or political rather than artistic ideas. The
city gets yet another statue of the leader or an ugly monument to national aspirations. A
third point is that governments often respond to fashions, and tastes in art can change
very rapidly. Without careful advice an expensive collection of worthless paintings or
tasteless productions can be the result.
However, it would be wrong to say that governments should not spend any money at all
on art. Painters, musicians, and composers cannot survive without financial support. Rich
people or large companies do finance art, but then it is often inaccessible to ordinary
people. Governments have a duty to make this art available to everyone. However, the
most important reason why governments should support the arts is because an
appreciation of art is one of the things that makes life worthwhile. Humans do not need
just shelter and food. Creative people have always tried to look at things in a new way
and to make the world a better place through painting, music, poetry, calligraphy,
sculpture, dance, and numerous other forms of expression. While art may not make us
immortal, it does make the world a richer place for future generations.
In conclusion, although people do need to be provided with the necessities of life, such as
housing and medical care, governments also have a duty to provide their citizens with
something more. They should make sure that they pass on beauty, ideas and expression
to the next generation and make art available to all instead of being the possession of
only the few. I firmly believe that spending money on art is a vital part of a government's
responsibility, and I am confident that my country will be able to contribute its share to the
richness of the world's art and creativity.",human
153,143,"Security cameras have become ubiquitous in many countries. Whereas before they
appeared only in banks and at high-security areas, they are now entering public places
such as malls, streets, stadiums and transport. Many people feel this affects their privacy.
This essay will examine whether the advantages of these cameras outweigh their
negative impact.
Surveillance cameras have several benefits. An obvious benefit is that the police can
catch criminals in the act, thus reducing crime. This will make the streets safer for ordinary
people. A more important point is that criminals, particularly young offenders or petty
criminals will be deterred. They will not be tempted to carry out crimes, and thus society
will be a lot safer. Cameras are also cost-effective and unobtrusive. Authorities do not
need to spend large amounts of money on police.
However, security cameras are far from being a perfect solution. The biggest objection
concerns privacy. Many people feel that they should be free to travel or move around a
shop, mall, street or country without being photographed or recorded. They feel that being
watched constantly is like being in a jail, and that ordinary people are losing their freedom
because of these devices. Another point is that although the police say that only criminals
have something to fear from the cameras, many people do not trust governments with too
much information. Corrupt authorities could use information in the wrong way or twist it to
victimize some groups. Thirdly, cameras and computers can make mistakes.
In conclusion, although there are definite advantages to using surveillance devices such
as cameras, we need to balance the need for security with respect for the individual's
privacy and freedom. If we do not trust the members of society, a situation like George
Orwell's ""1984"" could be the result.",human
154,144,"It is certainly very understandable that some governments should start looking at ways of
limiting their populations to a sustainable figure. In the past, populations were partly
regulated by frequent war and widespread disease, but in recent years the effects of
those factors have been diminished. Countries can be faced with a population that is
growing much faster than she nation's food resources or employment opportunities and
whose members can be condemned to poverty by the need to feed extra mouths. They
identify population control as a'means to raising living standards.
But how should it be achieved? Clearly, this whole area is a very delicate personal and
cultural issue. Many people feel that this is not a matter for the state. They feel this is one
area of life where they have the right to make decisions for themselves. For that reason, it
would seem that the best. approach would be to work by persuasion rather than
compulsion This could be done by a process of education that points out the way a
smaller family can mean an improved quality of life for the family members, as well as less
strain on the country's perhaps very limited, resources.
This is the preferred way. Of course if this docs not succeed within a reasonable time
scale, it may be necessary to consider other measures. such as tax incentives or childbenefit payments for small families only. These are midway between persuasion and
compulsion.
So. yes. it is sometimes necessary, but governments should try very hard to persuade
first. They should also remember that this is a very delicate area indeed, and that social
engineering can create as many problems as it solves?",human
155,145,"I tend to agree that young children can be negatively affected by too much time spent on
the computer every day. This is partly because sitting in front of a screen for too long can
be damaging to both the eyes and the physical posture of a young child, regardless of
what they are using the computer for.
However, the main concern is about the type of computer activities that attract children.
These are often electronic games that tend to be very intense and rather violent. The
player is usually the ‘hero’ of the game and too much exposure can encourage children to
be self-centred and insensitive to others.
Even when children use a computer for other purposes, such as getting information or
emailing friends, it is no substitute for human interaction. Spending time with other
children and sharing nonvirtual experiences is an important part of a child's development
that cannot be provided by a computer.
In spite of this, the obvious benefits of computer skills for young children cannot be
denied. Their adult world will be changing constantly in terms of technology and the
Internet is the key to all the knowledge and information available in the world today.
Therefore it is important that children learn at an early age to use the equipment
enthusiastically and with confidence as they will need these skills throughout their studies
and working lives.
I think the main point is to make sure that young children do not overuse computers.
Parents must ensure that their children learn to enjoy other kinds of activity and not simply

they would make people's jobs easier. What was not expected was that computers would
eliminate jobs. Besides contributing to unemployment, these automated workers often
exhibit inadequate job performance.
A number of jobs have been lost as a direct result of new computer technology. Ticket
agents in various transportation facilities, from subway/underground stations to airports
are virtually nonexistent these days. Bank tellers have been greatly reduced due to
automated bank machines. In addition, many call centers/centres that have help lines are
almost entirely computerized/computerised. A few years ago I worked as a helper in our
local library. Today this position does not exist, because six new computers have been
installed. The number of positions lost to computers grows exponentially, and
unemployment continues to get worse.
While a computer may easily achieve the main tasks of these jobs, most computers fall
short when customers have a unique request or problem. A pre-paid ticket booth does not
have insight about the entertainment district and cannot offer friendly directions to a
tourist. Similarly, an automated bank machine cannot provide assistance and reassurance
to a customer who has just had his credit card stolen. And, more often than not,
automated telephone operators cannot answer the one question that we have, and we
end up waiting on the line to speak with someone anyway. Every time I go into the library

can't find anyone to help.

inventions. However, other people think that computers make their life more stressful. I
agree with those people who think that computers brought many benefits and play a very
important role in our modern life.
First of all, every company nowadays uses a computer to store its data and make different
kinds of operations. It is very difficult to imagine life without computers. A company would
have to store millions of papers and documents. Moreover, a customer would have to wait
hours to check his balance or get a piece of information about his transactions at his
bank, while an employee was looking trough those papers. Another important aspect of
this is that people are able to type all their information, make corrections, print or send
documents using computers. It makes life much easier. One can spend the rest of the
time watching TV with his family or working on something new.
We use computers every day sometimes even not knowing it. When we go to a store and
use our credit cards many computers process our information and perform transactions.
When we need to get some cash we use money access machines that are computerized
too.
Second of all, computers provided a great means of communication - the Internet. I think
it is the easiest and cheapest way to get in touch with relatives, friends, business
colleagues, etc. Nowadays the world becomes smaller and smaller. When I was a little
girl, I could not imagine that it would be possible to communicate with people from all
around the world in so easy way. A person can get latest news, become friends with
someone from another country, find his old friends, ask for a piece of advice, etc.
Finally, in addition to these practical benefits people can shop without leaving their house.
They just use an Internet access, a computer and their cards to make a payment. It is
kind of difficult to imagine that a few years ago people had to spend their time in lines
buying tickets. Now, a person can choose a destination, company, date and time and get
tickets delivered to his door. I think it is amazing.

the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go
wrong. If one small program fails disaster.

difficult tasks but is this excessive dependance ripping the warmth of our lives? In this
essay, I will outline how the availability of computers affects our lives.
Most of the daily tasks an individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These
two fundemental qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The
average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an
hour to and hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally
reduced to half if computerized decivesare used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman
is enabled to easily close a profitable deal just with a touch on this highly programmed
laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling
long distances just to sign a deal.
On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern
utilities, which make them handicapped when it comes to preparing a cup of tea.
Inaddition, psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for sucidal rate increase is
recent electric inventions. This is due to that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy
through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a
financially satisfying standard of life they gradually isulate themselves. As time passes by
each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads
to suicidal attempts specially among youngsters.
In conclusion, similar to every other invention computers has its benefits and drawbacks, I
personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key
here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.",human
161,150,"There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people's lives,
especially in the field of education. Nowadays, an increasing number of students rely on
computers to research for information and to produce a perfect paper for school
purposes. Others have decided to leave the original way of learning to get knowledge
through online schools. These changes in the learning process have brought a special
concern regarding the possible decrease of importance of teachers in the classroom.
Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been
helping some students to progress in their studies quicker than when compared with an
original classroom. For example, in the same classroom, students have different
intellectual capacities, thus some would be tied to a slow advance in their studies
because of others’ incapacity of understanding. In this way, pupils could progress in their
acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using computers instead of learning from
teachers.
However, the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact
influences them in positive ways. Firstly, students realize that they are not dealing with a
machine but with a human being who deserves attention and respect. They also learn the
importance of studying in group and respect other students, which helps them to improve
their social skills.
Moreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some
student's deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same
explanation, giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor. Hence, students
can have a bigger chance not to fail in a subject.
In conclusion, the role for teachers in the learning process is still very important and it will
continue to be in the future because no machine can replace the human interaction and
its consequences.

In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated
computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no
individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but
they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be
able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in
the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go
wrong. If one small program fails disaster.
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly
complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to
control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is
controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be
suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never
become totally dependent on a completely technological world.

PCs, Internet, hand phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable that people look
to the future of computers. In what field will be computers used for and what role will
human has in this world in future?
Besides, computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product
we plan to buy or place we plan to visit over a second using personal computer and
Internet. Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new
perfume using Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the theater. According
to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace job of cashiers, civil and military pilots.

Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people
spend more time behind monitors that ever before. And some of them feel a need for
more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, fall out of one of the
important modules of specific computer can entail serious consequences. Suffice to
mention computer problem, occurred in the end of 1990s, problem concerned with coming

164,152,"These days with increasing urban populations, there are major problems with congestion
and not only the price, but also availability of accommodation in large cities of the world. It
seems that one possible solution could be to relocate large companies and factories as
well as their respective employees out of these urban areas and into more rural ones. In
my opinion, I strongly agree that this would have a desired effect in making cities more
livable.
To begin with, the traffic problem in cities doesn’t only exist from commuting employees,
but also the general public travelling around the city. While this may be a fact, if the
number of worker’s vehicles is reduced on city streets, a large percentage of traffic will
obviously decline in rush hours. For example, peak hour traffic is undoubtedly made up
largely of staff from companies going to and from home.
Secondly, in regards to housing problems, populations will always continue to grow in
cities and therefore inadvertently decrease the number of cheap and available
apartments. This is certainly obvious, however, a large proportion of these apartments are
occupied by employees from large firms and their families. If this workforce is relocated to
housing estates in the country, city apartment blocks will fall in price and certainly
increase in availability.
In conclusion, by relocating workers to rural areas to work and reside, heavy traffic
conditions and lack of adequate accommodation in city centres will obviously change for
the better. As far as I’m concerned, I agree that the government should enforce such a
law in order to increase our standard of living in our hectic city life.",human
165,1531,"The more people that there are in the world, the more cars there are on the road. People
are richer too and often families have more than one car. It has been proved that building
more roads does not work; it just encourafes more traffic.
So, what can we do? People like their cars and the freedom and independence that cars
give them. One possibility would be to raise car taxes and fuel taxes so that people do not
want to spend the extra money. Taxes on new car sales as well could be increased in
order to discourage people from buying. Perhaps a used car sales tax could be
introduced too. In the same way motorways could have tolls charged for using them
although this may just increase congestion on smaller roads as people try and avoid the
motorways. The government that introduces such ideas will not be popular though and
would probably lose power. Governments would therefore be unlikely to set up such new
measures. 
I think it would be better to try and change people‛s attitudes and offer them alternatives.
Educate them more about the pollution and waste that they are causing. Persuade them
to car share, use public transport or even cycle if the distances are not too long. Countries
such as Holland and Denmark are well known for how their citizens are passionate about
green issues and how they use bicycles when they can.
Reducing traffic is a difficult task. I don‛t think it is possible realistically to reduce car
numbers but I do think that we can change people‛s attitudes and get them to use
different ways of travelling.",human
166,1532,"Traffic Congestion in Abu Dhabi
Abu Dhabi is a modern city but also has a modern problem: traffic jams. In the early
mornings, and again in the evening, around 8 pm, the streets are crowded with cars,
taxis, and trucks. This essay will explain the causes of gridlock in Abu Dhabi and discuss
the effects of this problem.
Abu Dhabi’s traffic problems stem from several causes. The rapid economic growth of
the emirate has enabled most residents to buy their own cars. This has put intense
pressure on the road system, which although it is highly developed, has not been able
to keep up with the expansion in population. Another cause is the absence of any major
public transport system such as buses or trains. Because of this, residents rely on
hordes of taxis, thus adding to the congestion. Yet another contributing factor is the
layout of the island. This limits road construction.
The resulting gridlock has several adverse effects. First of all is the frustration and
anger felt by road-users. This can result in tension and accidents, and, ironically,
emergency vehicles may not even be able to reach the scene of such accidents. Another
effect is the waste of time spent in traffic. This lowers productivity at work and contributes
to reduced time at school and with family. There are also additional costs to the city in
terms of air pollution and unnecessary fuel consumption. Shopping and daily errands
become more of a chore, and the city suffers.
Commuters and road-users will need to cooperate with municipal authorities as they
introduce measures to reduce congestion. However, Abu Dhabi has shown its ability to
rise to challenges in the past, and most residents are confident that the city will still be an
attractive place to live as the problem of traffic is addressed.",human
167,154,"I think wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth among poorer nations. But
their helping should only stop at providing such things as food and education because of
three following reasons.
Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore,
we can not look at, hear of, and talk about people who lack food, education, etc… without
compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth among poorer nations is not only a good deed
but also a task itself.
Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are very very poor. Famine, diseases, crime
and illiteracy are killing their citizens. In the contrary, a lot of nations in Europe and
America are too rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase
dramatically. Poor countries will become more and more poorer while rich countries will
become more and more richer. As a result, poorest countries will be slaves of richest
countries. So, sharing wealth is an useful way to prevent people from that bad future.
Thirdly, although sharing wealth among poorer nations is very necessary but this helping
should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor
nations may depend on aid. They won’t have enthusiasm to build their countries by
themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere
deeply in poor nations’ governments. This can’t be considered humane action and should
be prevented.
In my opinion, sharing wealth among poorer nations has both bad side and good side.
What we have to do is avoiding its bad side and practicing its good side.
This is an excellent essay, your arguments are convincing and very well presented.
There are only a few minor mistakes, read and consider the comments. Very well
done!'",human
168,155,"Today's world has been divided into developing and industrialised countries which the
main difference between them is the amount of money that governments apply in
important sectors such as education, health and commerce. Most of the poorer nations
are buried in debts as a result of their unbalanced finances which are reflect in a failed
health care, an unstructured education system and a weak international trade. This
vicious cycle will continue indefinitely unless wealthier nations show interest in minimizing
the worldwide economic differences, as well as taking more responsibility for assisting
unfortunate countries.
Most of the African countries live in sub-human conditions because of the extreme
poverty, upheaval, hunger, disease, unemployment, lack of education and both
inexperienced and corrupt administrations. The devastating consequences of the AIDS
epidemic in those countries could improve if the infected populations receive free drugs to
control the disease, have access to health professionals and get information on how to
prevent its spread. But this can only be achieved through international help programs in
which leaders of the world's richest countries donate medicine and also send doctors and
nurses to treat and educate those in need.
Moreover, most of the poor countries rely on selling agricultural products and raw material
to rich nations and buying industrialized products from them resulting in a huge financial
deficit. Consequently,
they borrow a significant amount of money from the World Bank to try to improve their
broken economies, but sometimes the money disappears with no significant changes and
they cannot even pay the interest to the bank. Regarding this issue, last year the G8,
which is comprised of leaders of the eight richest nations, decided to forgive billions of
dollars worth of debt owed by the world?s poorest nations. In addition, they developed
adequate loan programs to financially assist those countries.
In conclusion, leaders of the industrialised countries play an indispensable role in
assisting developing nations deal with essential areas such as health, education and
trade. Also, their aid is the key to breaking the vicious cycle, which results in poverty and

169,156,"Reducing the wealth gap can be achieved by cancelling third world debt, cancelling trade
and farming subsidies so that third world countries can compete, getting rid of third world
corruption and investing and building in third world countries using local people and skills
and allowing them ownership of businesses. There are other things as well. Unfortunately
there is no profit in business for first world countries to do these things. Some will do them
but most will not. The ordinary man on the street wants things to be better for poorer
countries and the politicians say that they will help but the politicians will in the end do
what business tells them to do. Politicians also rightly feel they have a duty to protect their
own countries and keeping economically dominant is part of this duty. Creating effective
competition for their own country‛s businesses is not part of what they are expected to do.
This then leads on to whether I believe that developed countries have a duty to help the
developing countries. Yes, I do. As an individual I believe that we have a duty to assist the
poorer countries with their development in all aspects. We can provide teachers and
education and doctors on the small scale and on the larger scale the things that I have
talked about in the previous paragraph. Can we do this? Yes. Will we do this? See the
previous paragraph again.
In conclusion you can see that I believe that there is a split between what would happen
in a perfect world and what actually happens. We have a duty to reduce the wealth gap
between developed and developing countries and we can do it, but it is unlikely that this
will happen quickly.",human
170,157,"Today, the world is becoming more and more closely linked. Trade has increased and
the movement of people between countries is greater than ever before. However, billions
of people still live in poverty, and in many places, the gap between rich and poor is
widening. This essay will look at the arguments for and against helping poor countries.
There are many reasons for helping poor countries. First of all, there are humanitarian
reasons. Like individuals who give to charity, many countries feel it is their religious,
social, or moral duty to help people in other countries who are suffering from famine,
drought, war, or disease. However, many rich countries also donate money for political or
diplomatic reasons. They want to maintain a relationship of dependency with the recipient,
or simply to influence the government and direction of the country. A further reason why
many countries help poorer ones is for economic reasons. The donors may want to
control the supply of commodities such as oil, water, or wheat. Alternatively, the richer
country may want to ensure markets for their own products, whether these are planes,
computers or shoes.
However, aid is not necessarily the best way to help a country. For one thing, billions of
dollars of aid often goes missing, into corrupt governments or inefficient administration. A
second point is that many foreign aid projects are unsuitable for the target country. Many
agencies build huge dams or industrial projects that fail after a few years or that do not
involve the local people. Furthermore, much aid returns to the donor. This can be in the
form of expensive specialized equipment and experts from the donor country.
There are many other ways we can help poor countries. Opening up trade barriers, so
that poor countries can sell their goods is one way. Another is to remove subsidies so that
imported goods from poorer countries can compete fairly. A third method is to forgive
debts. Many poor countries have huge interest repayments on old loans.
The needs of the poorer countries may seem obvious. However, although our humanity
makes us want to help eliminate poverty and suffering, we must examine the real needs
of poor countries and implement solutions that will benefit both them and us.",human
171,158,"It is generally accepted that we all need leisure time to recover from the stresses of work
and everyday life.
Personally, I prefer to be active during this time, as I think this suits me better. However,
what we do with our leisure time is up to us and no one can say that any particular activity
is the best.
Some people relax by watching movies, reading or surfing the internet. People who have
physically demanding jobs may choose these types of activities. If you are a nurse or
builder, you may feel that you don't want to do a five-kilometre run after work, because
you are already physically tired.
Other people do very sedentary jobs. Computer analysts, for example, may spend all day
sitting in front of a computer screen. At the end of the working day, they may be keen to
stretch their limbs and improve their health by swimming or going to the gym.
Another factor that influences our choice of leisure pursuit is where we work. People who
work indoors often prefer outdoor hobbies, whereas for people who work outdoors, the
reverse may be true. I am a student myself and this involves a lot of sitting in lectures, so I
need to get out into the fresh air afterwards.
In any situation, the important thing is that people need to stay healthy by choosing what
is best for them. The only wrong way to spend free time, in my view, is to have a
sedentary job and then go home and watch television.",human
172,159,"Nowadays people have so many things to do that they almost always do not have enough
time for it. When we go to bed we carefully think and plan our next day and it continues
day in and day out. We wake up, recollect our checklist with things to do and in a few
minutes we are already in a car on our way to the office. Often people do not have time
for themselves. So, when people have some spare time they want to use it wisely. Some
people prefer to plan activities for their free time very carefully. However, others prefer not
to make any plans. In this essay I will analyze both cases and present my view in favor of
planning free-time activities.
From the one side, not making any plans and just letting the time pass by for some time
have some benefits. First of all, a person can just relax, enjoy the beautiful moments,
spend his or her time with loved ones, watch a movie, listen to relaxing music, observe
the flowers in bloom from the window, contemplate about his or her life and just slow
down the pace of life. I think it is a very good way to eliminate one's stress and tension
and just leave all troubles and worries behind.
From the other side, careful planning can bring many benefits too. First of all, one can
travel. However, traveling requires some planning to be made. For example, one most
likely will need a hotel room. So, the reservation should be made beforehand. Also, it is
wise to check one's car to avoid breakdowns and have an uninterrupted worry-free trip.
Second of all, planning one's activities allows to spend one's free time the way he/she
likes. For instance, if I want to play tennis on incoming week-end I will certainly make a
reservation for a court because in this case I will not be disappointed with the waste of my
time. Personally, I prefer to make plans for my free time because it allows me to spend my
vacation or week-ends the way I want it.
To sum up, I think careful planning allows people to derive maximum benefits from their
free time. However, I must confess sometimes I allow my self just to stay at home with my
friends and family and not make any plans.",human
173,160,"I do not agree with the statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a
profit. I state my opinion on the following points.
First of all, every company must have its moral code. It means that a company should
treat its clients properly and respect their rights. Of cause a company may lose a part of
its profit but security of its clients must be on the first place. Otherwise, clients will switch
to another company and never be back. For instance, a few years ago ""Jonson&Jonson""
produced a new type of painkillers. Unfortunately, this product was not tested properly. As
a result of this many people died and received injures. The president of the company
made a crucial decision to call back all painkillers from all distributors and pay to all
injured customers for their treatment. It cost a lot of money for the company but it saved
its image and clients. It was a very difficult decision, but the president of the company
understood that it would cost him even more in the future because he would not be able
to return clients' respect. Loosing customers means for a company loosing its profit.
Second of all, in order to succeed in the modern world companies have to compete with
each other. Many companies lose their profit decreasing prices on their products. They do
not aspire for extra profit but for clients' satisfaction. Companies do it because they want
their products sold and their customers satisfied. They offer discounts, free delivery, free
service, free Internet access, good return service, etc. All these are done to make their old
customers happy and attract new clients.
To sum up, I think a company, which the only goal is profit will not succeed nowadays.
Otherwise, companies that respect their clients and want to see them satisfied will make a
fortune.",human
174,161,"Nowadays, as roads are becoming more and more crowded, people are considering both
the advantages and disadvantages of having a car before they buy one.
The main advantage of the car is that it gives the freedom to travel when and where you
want, without being limited to fixed routes and timetables. What is more, you can carry
several passengers and as much luggage as you like, at no extra cost. In addition to this,
you can travel in comfort in a car, with a seat to yourself and the possibility of comforts
such as a music system and air conditioning.
On the other hand, owning a car is very expensive. As well as the price of the car, the
cost of tax, insurance, petrol and repairs must also be considered before buying.
Moreover, the increase in traffic means that drivers are spending more and more time
stuck in traffic jams. Perhaps the major disadvantage of cars in general is the huge
damage that they do to human life and to the environment, and all motorists much accept
that they are making a small contribution to this.
To sum up, provided you have access to an efficient public transport system, then buying
and running your own car could be considered an expensive luxury.",human
175,162,"Today the way we consider human psychology and mental development is heavily
influenced by the genetic sciences. We now understand the importance of inherited
characteristics more than over before. Yet we are still unable to decide whether an
individual’s personality and development are more influenced by genetic factors (nature)
or by the environment (nurture).
Research, relating to identical twins, has highlighted how significant inherited
characteristics can be for an individual's life. But whether these characteristics are able to
develop within the personality of an individual surely depends on whether the
circumstances allow such a development. It seems that the experiences we have in life
are so unpredictable and so powerful, that they can boost or over-ride other influences,
and there seems to be plenty of research findings to confirm this.
My own view is that there is no one major influence in a person's life. Instead, the traits
we inherit from our parents and the situation and experiences that we encounter in life are
constantly interacting. It is the interaction of the two that shapes a person's personality
and dictates how that personality develops. If this were not true, we would be able to
predict the behavior and character of a person from the moment they were born.
In conclusion, I do not think that either nature or nurture is the major influence on a
person, but that both have powerful effects. How these factors interact is still unknown
today and they remain largely unpredictable in a person’s life.",human
176,163,"From my everyday experience and observation I can claim that discussion of an important
decision with other people bring many benefits. In the following paragraphs I will give my
reasons to defend this statement.
First of all, different people have different opinions. In order to make the right choice
people should discuss every possible decision and its consequences. Making an
important decision alone can bring many negative aspects. For instance, a person can
reveal his selfishness or impatience and the consequences of that decision can affect
many people in the future. I think that a good and wise decision can be born only in
discussion because people can share their knowledge and experiences a look at the
problem from different sides and aspects.
Second of all, I think that making decision alone is unacceptable especially for a
company. Imagine that a chief makes the decision about increasing a production line
without discussing it with his employees. In this case a part of company's profit will be
spending on extended purchase of raw materials. So, share holders will be left without
dividends. This decision may lead to getting rid of company's shares and as a result of
this declining the value of a company as a whole.
To sum up, I think that a person should always consult his relatives or colleges when
making an important decision to avoid possible mistakes.",human
177,164,"I think the question what would I do if I had a chance to improve my community is difficult.
I have in my mind many things, the improvement of which will make our community better
place to live but they all require the participation of many people and, moreover, they
require investments, which I can not provide. For example, my community is quite noisy.
We have the huge mall just in front of our community, so traffic jams are very common for
this place. I think that the construction of a few pass-by roads will benefit all people who
live here as well as people who drive by every day.
Unfortunately, the question is what I can do for my community giving a few hours of my
time every month. I think I can not do much, but I still can help someone in my
community. For example, I can baby-sit. I know a couple of families with little children,
who can not afford to spend much money on the baby-sitter. One of these families is a
single mom with a little girl. Julia, this is her name, is a waitress in a restaurant. She is a
great person and we became close friends. So, sometimes I offer her help with her child
when she has to work in the evenings. Another family has two funny little twins. One time
their parents asked me to babysit their children because they had to attend an
unexpected presentation.
I think this kind of help brings many benefits to my community. First of all, people become
friendlier. For example, those families, which I mentioned above, became friends after I
introduced them to each other. Second of all, people get to know each other and feel
more secure in their houses and apartments. Finally, I am ready to help those people
because I am sure that they will help me too. One time I lost the keys from my car and
Julia offered me her car for a while.
To sum up, I believe that baby-sitting is a great way to help my community in many
aspects.",human
178,165,"If I could change one thing about my hometown, I think it would be the fact that there’s no
sense of community here. People don’t feel connected, they don’t look out for each other,
and they don’t get to know their neighbors.
People come and go a lot here. They change jobs frequently and move on. This means
that they don’t put down roots in the community. They don’t join community organizations
and they’re not willing to get involved in trying to improve the quality of life. If someone
has a petition to put in a new street light, she has a very hard time getting a lot of people
to sign. They don’t feel it has anything to do with them. They don’t get involved in
improving the schools because they don’t think the quality of education is important to
their lives. They don’t see the connection between themselves and the rest of their
community.
People don’t try to support others around them. They don’t keep a friendly eye on their
children, or check in on older folks if they don’t see them for a few days. They’re not
aware when people around them may be going through a hard time. For example, they
may not know if a neighbor loses a loved one. There’s not a lot of community support for
individuals.
Neighbors don’t get to know each other. Again, this is because people come and go
within a few years. So when neighbors go on vacation, no one is keeping an eye on their
house. No one is making sure nothing suspicious is going on there, like lights in the
middle of the night. When neighbors’ children are cutting across someone’s lawn on their
bikes, there’s no friendly way of casually mentioning the problem. People immediately act
as if it’s a major property disagreement.

that sense of community.",human
179,166,"Traveling is a good way to find out more about different countries with different traditions
and customs. Some travelers prefer to spend in one country just a few days or one day
and then leave for another country. This way of traveling allows people to visit more
countries in fewer days. Unfortunately, in this case such travelers have to hurry in order to
visit more places.
I am from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. So, if a foreign visitor has only one day to spend in
my country I think I would advice him to visit the ""Hermitage"" - the most well known and
amazing museum in Russia. The ""Hermitage"" has 3 floors and more then 100 halls. It is
really amazing to visit that place. Many people from all over the world every day enter its
walls. Some of the rooms devoted to the history of other countries. Others devoted to the
art of a famous painter and the history of his life. However, most of the halls conclude
many things such as paintings, royal belongings, sculptures from Russian history.
Some people say that it is impossible to feel deeply and see all these amazing historical
values for one visit. I have to completely agree with this statement. When I first visited the
""Hermitage"" I was 14 years old. It impressed me so much that I was back next day to see
what I had not been able to see the day before.
The ""Hermitage"" is an impressive and beautiful museum. I think it is worth to spend there

180,167,"As a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become
stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries. Just like movie stars,
they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars.
Many people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries
with those of top surgeons or research scientists, or even leading politicians who have the
responsibility of governing the country. However, sports salaries are not determined by
considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or
she holds. Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and the level of
public support that successful stars can generate. So the notion of ‘fairness’ is not the
issue.
Those who feel that sports stars’ salaries are justified might argue that the number of
professionals with real talent are very few, and the money is a recognition of the skills and
dedication a person needs to be successful. Competition is constant and a player is
tested every time they perform in their relatively short career. The pressure from the
media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight. So all of these factors may
justify the huge earnings.
Personally, I think that the amount of money such sports stars make is more justified than
the huge earnings of movie stars, but at the same time, it indicates that our society places
more value on sport than on more essential professions and achievements.",human

bring many benefits to society. It is a controversial question weather the contributions of
artists are more or less then the contributions of scientists to the society. For several
reasons, which I will mention bellow, I think that both types are valuable, priceless and
irreplaceable for every society.
The contributions of artists to the society are very essential. Art can form person’s spiritual
sense, their views and personalities. People learn history, the traditions of their country
trough the art. We also watch movies that entertain and at the same time extend our
range of interests. Another important aspect of this is that art is an ancient means of
communication. In old times people depicted the herds of mammoths on the walls of their
caves. They performed different rituals around the fireplace asking their gods for health,
good harvest and weather. Our language is a result of people's need to communicate.
From the other side, the contribution of scientists is could not be exaggerated. All
humankind is indebted to the scientists because of their work and achievements.
Scientists make our life easier. We have cars and airplanes to move fast from one place
to another. We have microwaves and a bunch of preprocessed food to make the cooking
much easier. We have different devices that simplify all we do. Finally, scientists are
making great achievements in medicine that make our life longer and happier. Nowadays
people have a great opportunity to do many things faster by use of computers.
To sup up, I believe that artists nourish our souls when scientists and technology feed our
minds. So, we can not eliminate or underestimate one of them.",human
182,169,"I certainly agree that people who come up with new ideas; in other words those who
'invent' or 'discover' things are terribly important to society as a whole. However, I also
think there is a role in society for good imitators.
No one would deny that key individuals must be thanked for providing us with certain
facilities that we use every day. Where, would we be, for example, without basic items
such as the washing machine, the television and, more recently, the computer? These
items are now used so regularly that we tend to take them for granted.
In fact, the society we live in today has become increasingly consumer-oriented, and
while it may be possible to constantly update and improve consumer goods, not everyone
where I live can afford the prices of these innovations. Furthermore not everyone lives in
an area that has accessibility to the latest models on the market. For this reason, there is
a value to be placed on being able to provide good copies of expensive items.
Having said that, certain innovations have a more serious impact on our lives than
consumer goods and cannot easily be replicated. Vital medicines like penicillin and
vaccines against dangerous diseases also exist because people made continual efforts to
develop them. Scientific ideas such as these enable us to live longer and escape illness.",human

It is no secret that children can be a great help around the house, and many believe that they should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so. While there are some advantages to this, I disagree that it should be required of them. 

For starters, children should not be expected to take on too much responsibility too soon. While it is important to teach them the value of hard work and to help them develop a sense of responsibility, they should not be expected to take on too much. Young children are still learning and developing, and they should be allowed to enjoy their childhood without feeling the pressure of too many obligations. 

In addition, it is important to remember that children are not always able to do the same tasks as adults. Even if they are capable of helping out, they may not be able to do the same quality of work as an adult. Furthermore, tasks that require a certain level of skill or knowledge, such as cooking or cleaning, may be too difficult for them to do properly. 

Finally, it is important to consider the impact that requiring children to help with household tasks may have on their mental health. It is possible that the pressure of having to help out may be too much for them to handle, and it may lead to feelings of stress and anxiety. 

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to requiring children to help with household tasks, I believe that it should not be required of them. It is important to remember that they are still developing, and they should be allowed to enjoy their childhood without feeling too much pressure.

Education is an essential part of a child’s life, and it is essential for the growth and development of a child. Education can be imparted either at home or in school. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods of education.

The primary advantage of educating a child at home is that parents are able to provide a more tailored education to suit the individual needs of their child. Parents are also able to provide a more nurturing environment for their child, as they are able to create a safe and secure environment in which their child can learn and grow. Additionally, parents are able to provide a more personalized education, as they are able to tailor the curriculum to suit their child’s individual needs.

However, there are some drawbacks associated with educating a child at home. Firstly, parents may not have the necessary qualifications or expertise to provide a comprehensive education. Secondly, there is a risk that the child may not be able to interact with other children, which can lead to social isolation. Finally, parents may not have the necessary resources to provide a comprehensive education.

On the other hand, educating a child in school has a number of advantages. Firstly, children are able to interact with other children, which can help them to develop social skills. Secondly, children are able to learn from experienced teachers, which can help them to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Finally, schools are able to provide a more comprehensive curriculum, which can help a child to develop a more well-rounded education.

Overall, it is clear that there are advantages and disadvantages to both educating a child at home and in school. Ultimately, it is up to the parents to decide which method of education is best suited to their child’s individual needs. However, it is important to note that parents can still help their children by providing support and guidance, regardless of whether they choose to educate their child at home or in school.

The debate surrounding the use of physical punishment to discipline children is one that has been ongoing for many years. On one side, many parents believe that physical punishment is an effective way to discipline their children, as it can act as an immediate consequence for misbehavior, and it can be used to reinforce positive behavior. On the other side, some argue that physical punishment is not effective in the long run, and can lead to further behavioral problems in the future.

Proponents of physical punishment argue that it can be an effective tool when used wisely. They point to studies that suggest that physical punishment can be effective in reducing disruptive behavior in children, and that it can be used to reinforce positive behavior. Furthermore, they argue that physical punishment is a natural consequence for misbehavior, and that it can be used to teach children important life lessons.

Opponents of physical punishment, however, argue that it does not have any positive long-term effects, and can actually lead to further behavioral issues in the future. They point to studies that suggest that physical punishment can be damaging to a child’s self-esteem and self-worth, and can lead to feelings of resentment and anger. Furthermore, they argue that physical punishment can lead to a lack of trust between parent and child, and can lead to a breakdown in communication.

In conclusion, while physical punishment can be an effective tool when used wisely, it is important to consider the long-term effects of such punishment. Parents should be aware of the potential risks associated with physical punishment, and should take into consideration other methods of discipline as well. Ultimately, it is up to the individual parent to decide what is best for their child.

Physical punishment for children is a controversial topic that has been debated for many years. While some people believe it is an effective way to discipline children, others argue that it can be damaging and has no place in the modern world. 

To begin with, physical punishment can be an effective way of disciplining children. It can be used to teach children right from wrong and to ensure they abide by the rules. For example, if a child is misbehaving in class, a teacher may use physical punishment as a way of making them understand the importance of behaving in a suitable manner. Furthermore, physical punishment can be used to make children more aware of the consequences of their actions, as they are more likely to remember the experience of being punished than simply being told off. 

However, physical punishment can also be damaging to children. It can lead to feelings of fear and insecurity, which can then have a negative impact on their development. For instance, research has shown that physical punishment is linked to lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of aggression in children. Additionally, physical punishment can be seen as a form of abuse, which can have long-term psychological effects on children. 

In conclusion, physical punishment can be an effective way of disciplining children, though it can also be damaging and have long-term effects. It is therefore important to consider the potential consequences of physical punishment before deciding whether or not to use it. Ultimately, physical punishment should only be used as a last resort, and other methods of discipline should be explored first.

Leisure activities are essential for children’s physical, mental and social development. Some people believe that these activities should be educational in order to be beneficial, but I disagree. I believe that leisure activities can be educational without necessarily having to be explicitly educational. 

Leisure activities are important for children’s development as they provide an opportunity to learn and develop skills. Through leisure activities, children can learn skills such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. These activities can also help children to develop their creativity and imagination. For example, playing with Lego or drawing can help children to develop their creativity and imagination. Additionally, leisure activities can also help children to develop their physical skills and coordination. For example, playing sports or dancing can help children to develop their physical skills and coordination.

However, leisure activities do not have to be explicitly educational in order to be beneficial. For example, playing video games can help children to develop their problem-solving skills, as well as their hand-eye coordination. Additionally, playing video games can also help children to develop their social skills, as many video games involve playing with others. Similarly, watching movies or reading books can also help children to learn about different cultures and ideas, without having to be explicitly educational.

In conclusion, I believe that leisure activities should not necessarily be educational in order to be beneficial for children. While educational leisure activities are important, there are also other activities which can help children to develop their skills and knowledge. Therefore, it is important for children to have a variety of leisure activities which can help them to develop in different ways.

The debate on whether children of different levels of intelligence should be taught together or separately has been a long-standing one. While some people argue that children should be taught together, regardless of their intelligence level, others believe that more intelligent children should be taught separately. In my opinion, I believe that both approaches have their merits and demerits and it is up to the parents, teachers, and schools to decide which approach would be suitable for the children.

On the one hand, teaching children of different levels of intelligence together can be beneficial. It can help to create a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. It can also give children the opportunity to interact with each other and learn from one another, regardless of their intelligence level. This can foster a sense of respect and understanding between the children, which can have a positive effect on their social and emotional development. Furthermore, it can also help to create a more stimulating and challenging learning environment, which can help to motivate children to push themselves and reach their full potential.

On the other hand, teaching more intelligent children separately can also have its advantages. It can help to create an environment that is tailored to the needs of the more intelligent children. This can help to challenge them and provide them with the opportunity to reach their full potential. It can also help to create an atmosphere of competition, which can help to motivate the children to work hard and strive for excellence. Furthermore, it can also help to create an atmosphere that is free from distractions, which can help the children to focus on their studies and reach their academic goals.

In conclusion, I believe that both approaches have their merits and demerits and it is up to the parents, teachers, and schools to decide which approach would be suitable for the children. While teaching children of different levels of intelligence together can help to create a more inclusive and diverse learning environment, teaching more intelligent children separately can help to create an environment that is tailored to their needs and help them to reach their full potential.

The lives of children today are vastly different from the lives of children in our generation. We are living in a world of rapid technological advancements and cultural changes, which has drastically changed the way children live their lives. In this essay, I will discuss the biggest changes in the younger generation and explain some of the factors that have contributed to this phenomenon.

One of the most significant changes in the lives of children today is the prevalence of technology. From smartphones to computers to tablets, children are now exposed to technology from a very young age. This has allowed them to access a wealth of information and knowledge, and it has also enabled them to stay connected with their peers and family members. Technology has also opened up new opportunities for entertainment and education, allowing children to explore the world in ways that were not possible before.

Another major change in the lives of children is the increased focus on education. With the advancement of technology and the rise of a global economy, there is a greater emphasis on academic performance. This has led to an increase in the number of hours that children spend studying and preparing for exams, as well as an increase in the amount of pressure they feel to perform well. 

The rise in the cost of living has also led to a change in the way that children live. With parents having to work longer hours in order to make ends meet, children are often left to their own devices, with less parental guidance and supervision. This has resulted in an increase in the number of children who are exposed to a variety of risks, such as cyberbullying, online predators, and substance abuse.

Finally, the changing cultural landscape has also had a significant impact on the lives of children. With the rise of multiculturalism and globalisation, children are now exposed to different cultures, beliefs, and values. This has led to an increase in the number of children who are exposed to different religions, languages, and customs.

In conclusion, the lives of children today are vastly different from the lives of children in our generation. This is due to a number of factors, including the prevalence of technology, the increased focus on education, the rise in the cost of living, and the changing cultural landscape. All of these factors have had an impact on the lives of children, and it is important to understand and address them in order to ensure that children are given the best possible start in life.

The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city has been ongoing for many years. While some people argue that living in the countryside provides a better environment for children, others believe that life in a big city offers more advantages. In my opinion, I believe that growing up in the countryside is better for children.

First of all, the countryside provides a healthier environment for children. The air is cleaner and the environment is less polluted than in a big city. This means that children are less likely to suffer from respiratory problems and other illnesses caused by air pollution. Moreover, the countryside is also a much quieter place, which can be beneficial for children’s mental health and well-being. The lack of noise pollution can help children to focus better and relax more easily.

Secondly, the countryside offers more opportunities for children to engage in outdoor activities. With plenty of open spaces, children can play and explore without worrying about traffic or other dangers. This can help to promote physical health and also foster a sense of independence and responsibility. Additionally, the slower pace of life in the countryside can help children to develop a better appreciation for nature and the environment.

Finally, living in the countryside can also provide children with a stronger sense of community. Smaller towns and villages are often much closer-knit than big cities, and this can help children to form strong relationships with their neighbours and learn important social skills. Furthermore, children in the countryside may also be more likely to receive support from their extended family, which can be beneficial for their emotional development.

In conclusion, I believe that children are better off growing up in the countryside than in a big city. Not only does the countryside provide a healthier environment, but it also offers more opportunities for physical and emotional development.

The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is a highly controversial issue that has been debated by various stakeholders for decades. Proponents of capital punishment argue that it is an effective measure to control violence in society and make people’s lives more secure, while opponents argue that it is a cruel and inhumane practice that should be abolished. In my opinion, capital punishment should not be used as a tool to control violence in society, as it has been proven to be ineffective in deterring crime and it has been linked to miscarriages of justice.

Firstly, there is no evidence to suggest that capital punishment is an effective deterrent for crime. Studies have shown that countries which have abolished the death penalty have experienced a decrease in the number of violent crimes. This suggests that capital punishment is not an effective measure to control violence in society. Furthermore, the death penalty has been linked to miscarriages of justice, as innocent people have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death in the past. This is a clear violation of human rights and should not be tolerated.

In conclusion, while it is true that capital punishment can be used to punish people who have committed serious crimes, it is not an effective measure to control violence in society. It has been proven to be ineffective in deterring crime and it has been linked to miscarriages of justice. Therefore, I disagree with the opinion that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society.

Marriage is an important event in a person’s life and the way it is arranged varies from culture to culture. In some countries, marriages are arranged by the parents of the couple, while in other cases, people choose their own marriage partner. Both systems have their pros and cons. 

In the case of arranged marriages, parents usually have the best interests of their children in mind when making the decision. They take into account factors such as financial stability, family background, and compatibility between the two families. This system has been part of many cultures for centuries, and it is believed that it is a good way to ensure that the couple is well-suited for each other. Moreover, the couple is usually supported by their families and the community, which can help them to build a strong and long-lasting relationship. 

On the other hand, allowing individuals to choose their own marriage partner gives them the freedom to decide who they want to spend the rest of their life with. This system allows people to find someone who shares their values and interests, and who they can build a strong connection with. This often leads to a stronger and more fulfilling relationship. Furthermore, the couple is more likely to be independent and able to make their own decisions. 

In conclusion, both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. It is important to consider the culture and the values of the couple when deciding which system to use. Ultimately, the most important thing is that the couple is happy and that their relationship is based on mutual respect and understanding.

In the last two decades, there have been considerable changes in the position of women in society. This has led to a situation where many married women are now working outside their homes, leaving their children to be taken care of by someone else. This has raised the question of whether this has caused the increase in juvenile delinquency among young people. In this essay, I shall discuss this opinion and explain my opinion on the matter.

To begin with, it is important to note that the increase in juvenile delinquency is a complex issue and cannot be attributed to one single factor. Factors such as poverty, peer pressure, mental health issues, and family breakdown all play a role in the rise of juvenile delinquency. Therefore, to suggest that the increase in juvenile delinquency is a result of married women working outside their homes is an oversimplification of the issue.

That said, it is true that the absence of a parent at home can have an impact on a child’s development. When a parent is not present, the child may lack the guidance, support, and discipline that are necessary for them to develop into responsible adults. This can lead to a lack of respect for authority, which can lead to delinquent behaviour.

However, it is important to note that the presence of a parent at home does not guarantee that a child will not engage in delinquent behaviour. There are many examples of children whose parents are present in the home but still engage in delinquent behaviour. This shows that the presence of a parent at home is not a guarantee of a child’s behaviour.

In conclusion, I believe that the position of women in society has changed markedly in the last twenty years and this has resulted in many married women now working outside their homes. However, while it is true that the absence of a parent at home can have an impact on a child’s behaviour, it is not the only factor that contributes to juvenile delinquency. Therefore, I disagree with the opinion that the increase in juvenile delinquency is a result of married women working outside their homes.

In a democratic society, it is essential to provide citizens with a guaranteed minimum income to ensure their basic human rights are met. Social welfare payments are an essential tool for achieving this goal, however, it is inevitable that some people will abuse the system.

The primary purpose of social welfare payments is to provide a source of income to those who are unable to work due to age, disability, illness or unemployment. This helps to ensure that all citizens are able to meet their basic needs and enjoy a reasonable quality of life. Without this support, many people would be unable to afford basic necessities like food, clothing and shelter, leading to a situation of poverty and deprivation.

Unfortunately, it is inevitable that some people will attempt to abuse the system by claiming benefits which they are not entitled to, or by exaggerating their need for assistance. This can lead to a situation where the resources available for genuine cases of need are stretched to the limit, leading to a situation where some people who need assistance are unable to access it.

However, it is important to remember that the vast majority of people who claim social welfare payments are genuine cases of need. It is also important to remember that the vast majority of people who do abuse the system are not able to get away with it for long, as they will eventually be caught and punished.

In conclusion, it is essential to provide citizens with a guaranteed minimum income in a democratic society. While it is inevitable that some people will abuse the system, it is important to remember that the vast majority of social welfare payments are made to genuine cases of need. It is also important to ensure that those who do try to abuse the system are caught and punished, to ensure that the resources available for genuine cases of need are not stretched too thin.

Education is the backbone of any society. It is the foundation upon which a nation’s future is built. It is for this reason that I strongly believe that all education, primary, secondary and further education, should be free to all people and paid for by the government.

The primary argument for free education is that it allows everyone an equal opportunity to pursue their dreams and goals. In a world where opportunities are often determined by wealth and social class, free education gives everyone the same chance to access quality education regardless of their economic or social background. This in turn leads to a more equitable society, where people are judged on their merits and not on their financial status.

Free education also provides a platform for the development of a nation’s economy. With a well-educated workforce, a nation is better placed to compete in the global market. In addition, free education helps to reduce the cost of living for citizens, as they are not burdened with the cost of tuition fees.

Furthermore, free education encourages students to stay in school and pursue their studies. This is especially important for disadvantaged students who may otherwise be forced to drop out of school due to financial constraints. With free education, these students can stay in school and have the same opportunities as their peers.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that all education, primary, secondary and further education, should be free to all people and paid for by the government. This will ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to access quality education, and will help to develop a nation’s economy and reduce the cost of living for citizens.

Violence is a major issue in the modern world and its presence in the media has been a major point of discussion for many years. There are some who believe that the amount of violence shown on TV and in the cinema affects the actions of our young people and increases the amount of violence in our society. I disagree with this statement and believe that there are other factors that contribute to the amount of violence in our society today.

Firstly, I believe that the amount of violence shown in the media is not the only factor that affects the actions of our young people. Other factors such as the presence of guns, poverty, and a lack of education all play a role in the amount of violence that exists in society. Furthermore, the media does not always portray violence in a positive light and can often be used to educate people about the consequences of violent behavior.

Secondly, I believe that the media can be used as a tool to reduce violence in our society today. For example, the media can be used to spread awareness about the dangers of violent behavior and to provide resources for those who are struggling with violence. Additionally, the media can be used to promote a culture of peace and understanding and to encourage young people to make positive choices.

Finally, I believe that the best way to reduce violence in our society today is to focus on the root causes of violence. This includes addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and a lack of access to education. Additionally, we need to focus on creating an environment where young people feel safe and supported and where they can access the resources they need to make positive choices.

In conclusion, I believe that the amount of violence shown in the media is not the only factor that contributes to the amount of violence in our society today. However, the media can be used as a tool to reduce violence in our society and the best way to do this is to focus on the root causes of violence and create an environment where young people feel safe and supported.

The responsibility of taking care of elderly people is a complex and challenging issue. In Britain, elderly people are usually sent to a care home, where they are looked after by nurses, and sometimes the government has to pay for this care. This raises the question of who should be responsible for caring for the elderly.

On the one hand, it can be argued that the government should take on the responsibility of caring for the elderly. By providing financial support, the government can ensure that elderly people receive the necessary care and medical attention. Furthermore, the government can also provide incentives for families to look after their elderly relatives, such as tax breaks or benefits. This would ensure that elderly people have access to the care they need without having to rely on the government.

On the other hand, it can be argued that families should take on the responsibility of caring for their elderly relatives. Families are in the best position to understand the needs of their elderly relatives, and can provide them with the necessary support and care. Furthermore, families can also help to ensure that elderly people are not isolated, as they can offer companionship and emotional support.

In conclusion, it is clear that both the government and families should take on the responsibility of caring for elderly people. The government can provide financial support, while families can offer companionship and emotional support. Ultimately, it is important to ensure that elderly people receive the care and attention they need, as this will help them to live happy and fulfilled lives.

In today’s world, the population is rising at an unprecedented rate, which is causing a variety of problems for both developed and developing countries. This essay will discuss some of the problems caused by overpopulation, and suggest a possible solution.

One of the most pressing issues caused by overpopulation is the lack of resources, such as food, water, and energy. With a growing population, there is an increased demand for these resources, which can lead to shortages and even famine. This is especially true in developing countries, where resources are already scarce and the population is growing at a rapid rate. Additionally, the strain on resources can cause an increase in prices, making it difficult for people to access the basic necessities they need to survive.

Another problem caused by overpopulation is environmental damage. The increased demand for resources leads to an increase in pollution, deforestation, and other forms of environmental degradation. This can have a devastating impact on the environment, leading to a decrease in biodiversity and an increase in global warming. Additionally, overpopulation can lead to overcrowding in cities, which can cause a variety of health and safety issues.

Finally, overpopulation can lead to increased levels of crime and violence. With a larger population, there is an increased demand for goods and services, which can lead to competition and even conflict. Additionally, overcrowding can lead to a decrease in living standards, which can lead to an increase in crime.

One possible solution to the problem of overpopulation is to implement population control measures. This could include providing access to contraception, providing education about family planning, and incentivising people to have fewer children. Additionally, governments could focus on increasing access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities, which can help to reduce poverty and encourage people to have fewer children.

In conclusion, overpopulation is causing a variety of problems for both developed and developing countries. These problems include a lack of resources, environmental damage, and increased levels of crime and violence. One possible solution to this problem is to implement population control measures, such as providing access to contraception and education about family planning.

Humans have been using land for various purposes since time immemorial. While it is true that land is essential for housing, industry, and agriculture, it is equally important to save land for endangered animals. I disagree with the view that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals.

Firstly, land is essential for the survival of many animal species. Endangered animals need land for their habitat, to look for food, and to breed. For example, the Bengal tiger is facing extinction due to the destruction of its natural habitat. If we do not save land for endangered animals, their numbers will continue to decline and they may eventually become extinct.

Secondly, conserving land for endangered animals can be beneficial to humans in the long run. Endangered animals play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance. For instance, the honey bee is an endangered species that is essential for pollination and thus, for the production of food. If we do not save land for them, it will have a negative impact on food production and may lead to food insecurity in the future.

Finally, saving land for endangered animals is not mutually exclusive to the needs of humans. We can easily find a balance between the two. For instance, we can set aside protected areas for endangered animals, while also providing land for housing, industry, and agriculture. This way, we can ensure the survival of endangered animals while also fulfilling human needs.

In conclusion, it is important to save land for endangered animals, as it is essential for their survival and also has long-term benefits for humans. We must find a balance between the needs of humans and the needs of endangered animals, in order to ensure a sustainable future for both.

The debate over whether children who are brought up in a family with less money are better equipped to handle problems in adulthood compared to those who are brought up in a wealthy family is an ongoing one. While some may argue that those who come from a less privileged background have to face more hardships, and hence, are better prepared to handle the struggles of adulthood, I believe that both types of upbringing can prepare children for their future. 

To begin with, it is true that children from less privileged backgrounds have to face more difficulties and hardships in life, thus, they learn to be resilient from an early age. They learn to be independent and take responsibility for their own actions. Moreover, since they are used to living with fewer resources, they develop a sense of frugality and understand the importance of money. This helps them in the long run as they are better able to manage their finances in adulthood. 

On the other hand, those who are brought up in a wealthy family have their own advantages. They have access to more resources and a better quality of life. This allows them to focus more on their studies and extracurricular activities. They learn to think out of the box and develop problem-solving skills. This helps them to become more creative and innovative in their professional life. 

From my own experience, I can say that both types of upbringing can prepare children for their future. My father, who comes from a lower-middle-class family, taught me the importance of hard work and financial discipline. On the other hand, my mother, who comes from a wealthy family, taught me how to think out of the box and be creative. These two aspects of my upbringing have helped me to become successful in my professional life. 

In conclusion, I believe that both types of upbringing can prepare children for their future. Children from less privileged backgrounds learn to be independent and develop financial discipline, while those from wealthy families learn to think out of the box and develop problem-solving skills. Thus, both types of upbringing have their own advantages and can help children to become successful in their future.

Action movies with spectacular car chases are immensely popular among the youth. These movies often involve dangerous stunts and high-speed chases that can result in fatal accidents if tried in real life. It is often argued that these movies lead to an increase in car accidents among young drivers as they try to copy what they have seen in the films.

It is true that these movies can have a negative influence on young drivers. Such movies glamorize dangerous driving, making it appear exciting and thrilling. This can lead to young drivers trying to imitate these stunts, resulting in reckless driving and increased accidents. Furthermore, these movies can desensitize young drivers to the risks of driving, leading them to take greater chances on the road.

In order to encourage young people to drive more safely, it is important to educate them about the risks associated with driving. Schools and universities should include road safety awareness programs in their curriculum to educate young drivers about the importance of following traffic rules. Additionally, the government should launch campaigns to spread awareness about the consequences of reckless driving.

Moreover, it is important to ensure that movies with car chases are not seen as role models by young drivers. The government should ensure that such movies are rated accordingly and are not accessible to young audiences. It is also important for filmmakers to ensure that their movies do not promote dangerous driving.

In conclusion, it is true that action movies with spectacular car chases can lead to an increase in car accidents among young drivers. To encourage young people to drive more safely, it is important to educate them about the risks associated with driving, launch awareness campaigns, and ensure that such movies are not seen as role models.

The idea of having a single global currency has been discussed by economists and politicians for many years, and it continues to be a hot topic of debate. On the one hand, having a single currency could make trade and travel a lot easier, as people wouldn’t have to worry about exchange rates or currency conversions. On the other hand, some people argue that having a single currency could cause more problems than it solves.

I believe that having a single global currency could make trade and travel easier, but it could also create some serious problems. For starters, it would be difficult to implement a single currency in a world where different countries have different economic systems. For example, some countries have higher inflation than others, and this could create economic imbalances if a single currency was used. Additionally, some countries may be reluctant to give up their own currency in favour of a global one.

In addition to the practical issues, there are also some ethical issues to consider. For example, a single currency could lead to a situation where richer countries have more influence over poorer countries. This could lead to an unfair advantage for those countries with more powerful economies, and could further widen the gap between the rich and the poor.

Overall, I believe that having a single global currency could make trade and travel easier, but it could also create some serious problems. Therefore, I think that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further before any decisions are made.

Advertising is a pervasive part of modern life. It is used to inform us about new products and services that can potentially improve our lives, but it can also be seen as a form of manipulation to encourage us to buy things that we do not need. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives on advertising and offer my opinion on the matter.

Advocates of advertising argue that it provides us with information about new products and services that can potentially improve our lives. For example, a new type of car may be advertised that is more fuel efficient than the one we currently own, or a new type of phone may be advertised that has features that could make our lives easier. This type of advertising can be seen as helpful, as it can provide us with useful information that can help us make better decisions about how to spend our money.

However, critics of advertising argue that it encourages us to buy things that we do not need. For example, advertisements may be used to create a false sense of urgency, or they may be used to make us feel inadequate if we do not have the latest product. This type of advertising can be seen as manipulative, as it can be used to exploit our insecurities and encourage us to make purchases that we would not otherwise make.

In my opinion, I believe that advertising can be both helpful and harmful. On the one hand, advertising can provide us with useful information about new products and services that can potentially improve our lives. On the other hand, it can also be used to manipulate us into buying things that we do not need. Therefore, I believe that it is important to be aware of both perspectives and to make informed decisions when it comes to spending our money.

In recent decades, television has had a profound impact on the culture of many societies. It has become a powerful medium of entertainment, education, and communication, and has had both positive and negative effects on the cultural development of my society. 

On the positive side, television has opened up a whole new world of knowledge and information to my society. It has provided access to a wide range of global cultures, allowing people to learn about different customs and traditions from around the world. This has helped to broaden people’s understanding of different cultures and has helped to promote cultural exchange and understanding. Furthermore, television has helped to spread awareness about important social issues, such as poverty, health, and education. This has helped to raise the standards of living in my society by bringing about positive social change. 

On the other hand, television has had some negative effects on the cultural development of my society. It has been accused of promoting a culture of consumerism, with many shows and commercials encouraging people to buy the latest products. This has led to a culture of materialism and has had a detrimental effect on the values of my society. In addition, television has been blamed for promoting a culture of violence and aggression. Many shows depict violent and aggressive behavior, which can have a negative effect on the behavior of viewers. 

In conclusion, television has had both positive and negative effects on the cultural development of my society. While it has provided access to a wealth of knowledge and information, it has also been accused of promoting a culture of consumerism and violence. It is therefore important to ensure that television is used responsibly and that it is used to promote positive values and cultural exchange.

When it comes to lodging a complaint about a product or service, I prefer to complain in writing. This is because it gives me the opportunity to clearly articulate my experience and expectations in a structured manner, and also provides me with a record of my complaint that can be referred to if necessary.

First and foremost, writing a complaint allows me to clearly and precisely express my thoughts and feelings, without the risk of being interrupted or misunderstood. It allows me to provide evidence and examples to support my claim, and to explain my expectations in detail. It also gives me the time to carefully consider my arguments and to make sure that my complaint is reasonable and justified.

Furthermore, writing a complaint gives me a record of my experience that I can refer to if necessary. For example, if I don’t receive a satisfactory response to my complaint, I can refer to the written record to remind the company of my expectations. This can be especially helpful if I need to escalate my complaint to a higher authority.

Finally, writing a complaint can be less intimidating than making a complaint in person. For some people, the prospect of making a complaint in person can be overwhelming and intimidating. Writing a complaint allows them to express their concerns in a more comfortable and relaxed environment.

In conclusion, when it comes to lodging a complaint about a product or service, I prefer to complain in writing. This is because it gives me the opportunity to clearly articulate my experience and expectations in a structured manner, and also provides me with a record of my complaint that can be referred to if necessary.

Television has been a part of our lives for decades, and it has been blamed for many issues in our society, including the destruction of communication among friends and family. While it is true that television can have a negative impact on relationships, I do not agree with the statement that it has destroyed communication among friends and family.

First of all, television is not the only factor that affects communication. There are other factors such as busy schedules, lack of time, and technology that can be just as detrimental to our relationships. For example, when people are busy at work, they may not have the time to catch up with friends and family, and this can lead to a decrease in communication. Similarly, technology such as smartphones and social media can be a distraction and lead to less face-to-face interaction.

In addition, television can actually be used to strengthen relationships. For example, watching a show together with family or friends can be a great way to bond and create memories. It can also be used as a way to stay connected with distant family members. Watching a show together can help to keep relationships alive even when people are physically apart.

Finally, television can be used as a tool to educate and inform people about important topics. It can inspire conversations about current events and social issues, and this can lead to meaningful conversations among family and friends.

In conclusion, while it is true that television can have a negative impact on relationships, I do not believe that it has destroyed communication among friends and family. In fact, it can be used as a tool to strengthen relationships and create meaningful conversations.

Advertising can tell us a lot about a country, and I agree with this statement. Advertising is a powerful tool used by companies to market their products and services and it is also a reflection of the culture and values of a particular country. Advertising campaigns often provide insight into the prevailing social norms, beliefs, and cultural practices in a country. 

For example, in India, we often see advertisements that feature traditional values and customs, such as the importance of family and respect for elders. This reflects the strong emphasis placed on family values and traditions in Indian culture. Similarly, in the United States, we often see advertisements that emphasize individualism and freedom. This reflects the American culture of independence and self-reliance.

In addition, advertising can also tell us about the economic conditions of a country. For example, if a country is experiencing an economic downturn, we may see more advertisements for discount products and services. This can be an indication of the economic conditions in the country. On the other hand, if a country is experiencing an economic boom, we may see more advertisements for luxury products and services.

Finally, advertising can also tell us about the political environment in a country. For example, in some countries, we may see advertisements that promote national pride and patriotism. This can be an indication of the political climate in the country. Similarly, in some countries, we may see advertisements that promote social justice and equality. This can be an indication of the political ideology of the country.

In conclusion, advertising can tell us a lot about a country. It reflects the cultural values, economic conditions, and political environment of a particular country. Therefore, I agree with the statement that advertising can tell us a lot about a country.

Advertising has become an integral part of modern life and there are two distinct views on the role it plays. Some people argue that advertising encourages us to buy things we do not need, while others argue that it informs us about new products that may enhance our lives. In my opinion, I believe that advertising can be beneficial in both ways.

On one hand, there is no doubt that advertising can lead us to buy things we do not need. This is especially true with targeted advertising, where companies use data to target potential customers with personalized ads. This often leads to impulse buying, where people buy products out of curiosity or a feeling of obligation. Furthermore, some companies use deceptive or manipulative advertising tactics to convince people to buy their products, such as false claims or exaggerated promises.

On the other hand, advertising can also be beneficial in informing us about new products and services that may improve our lives. For example, advertisements can help us to learn about new technologies or products that may make our lives easier or more enjoyable. They can also provide us with information about discounts and special offers, which can help us to save money. In addition, advertising can help to raise awareness about important social issues, such as environmental protection or animal rights.

In conclusion, advertising can be both beneficial and detrimental. While it can lead us to buy things we do not need, it can also provide us with useful information about new products and services. It is therefore important to be aware of the potential pitfalls of advertising and to make informed decisions when purchasing products.

Television programs have been an integral part of children’s lives for decades now. While there are some people who believe that television programs are of no value for children, I strongly disagree with this point of view. 

Firstly, television programs can be a great source of entertainment for children. Watching cartoons and other educational programs can help children to learn about different cultures, languages, and even science topics. Moreover, television programs can help children to develop their imagination and creativity. For instance, a child who watches a TV show about a superhero may be inspired to create their own stories, or even their own superhero. 

Secondly, television programs can help children to stay informed. News programs, educational shows, and documentaries can help children to stay up to date with current events, and can also help to broaden their knowledge of the world. In addition, some television programs may offer children moral lessons and important life lessons. For example, a children’s program may show the importance of helping others, or the consequences of making bad decisions. 

Finally, television programs can help children to develop social skills. Watching shows with other children can help to improve their communication skills and teach them how to interact with others. Additionally, some television programs may feature characters that children can relate to, which can help them to feel less alone and more connected to their peers. 

In conclusion, I believe that television programs can be of great value to children. Not only can they provide entertainment, but they can also help children to stay informed, learn important life lessons, and develop social skills.

The mass media, including television, radio and newspapers, have always been a powerful tool in influencing the opinions of people. It is undeniable that these media have the potential to shape people’s ideas, but to what extent this is true is a matter of debate.

On one hand, it is true that the mass media have the power to shape people’s ideas. It is a fact that people are exposed to a variety of information and opinions through these media. This can be seen in the way that people’s beliefs and opinions about certain topics can be heavily influenced by what they see and hear in the media. For instance, a news report about a political issue can influence people’s views on the same issue. Similarly, a movie or TV show can also have a significant impact on people’s opinions.

On the other hand, it is important to note that the extent to which the mass media shape people’s ideas is limited. It is true that people are exposed to a variety of information and opinions through the media, but this does not necessarily mean that they will form their own ideas based solely on what they have seen or heard. People’s ideas can also be shaped by other sources, such as personal experience, family and friends, and their own research and analysis.

Advertising is an integral part of modern life and it is impossible to escape it. It is a form of communication used to persuade people to buy products or services. Some people believe that advertising is a positive part of our lives, while others argue that it has a negative impact.

On the one hand, there are those who believe that advertising has a positive effect on our lives. They argue that it provides us with information about different products and services, which can be helpful when making decisions about purchases.

It is a common observation that children learn faster than adults. This is especially true when it comes to the acquisition of new skills such as languages, music, games, and computer programs. Small children appear to have a natural ability to absorb new concepts quickly and easily. Adults, on the other hand, often struggle to learn and retain new information.

There are several reasons why children learn more quickly than adults. Firstly, children are more open-minded and curious than adults, which helps them to explore and experiment with new ideas. They are less likely to be held back by fear of failure or by preconceived notions and are more willing to take risks. Secondly, children have less experience and knowledge than adults and therefore have fewer preconceptions and biases to overcome. This allows them to approach new topics with a fresh perspective and learn more quickly.

Thirdly, children are in a period of rapid physical and mental development, which increases their ability to take in new information and process it quickly. They also have more time to dedicate to learning as they are not burdened with the same responsibilities as adults. Finally, children are often taught in a more engaging and interactive way than adults, which helps them to absorb and retain new knowledge more effectively.

In conclusion, it is clear that children learn more quickly than adults due to a combination of factors such as openness, lack of experience, and rapid physical and mental development. They are also more likely to be taught in a more engaging and interactive way, which helps them to learn more effectively.

The debate between whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or a big city has been going on for many years. While some people believe that the countryside is better for children, others think that the city is more beneficial. In my opinion, I believe that the countryside is a better option for children.

Firstly, the environment in the countryside is much more conducive to a healthy lifestyle. Children in the countryside have access to plenty of outdoor activities such as swimming, fishing, and hiking. These activities help children stay active and healthy, as well as develop their physical strength. In addition, the air quality in the countryside is usually much better than in cities, which can help to reduce the risk of respiratory illnesses.

Secondly, living in the countryside can also provide children with a more peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. The hustle and bustle of city life can be overwhelming for children, and living in the countryside can offer them a much-needed break. This can help them to focus better on their studies and develop a better sense of self-awareness. Moreover, children in the countryside can also benefit from the slower pace of life, which can help them to appreciate the beauty of nature.

Finally, children growing up in the countryside are more likely to have strong family ties. This is because the rural environment encourages strong family values and a sense of community. Children in the countryside are more likely to be surrounded by extended family members, which can help to create a strong support system. This can be beneficial for children as it can help them to develop better social skills and emotional intelligence.

In conclusion, I believe that the countryside is a better option for children to grow up. The environment in the countryside is more conducive to a healthy lifestyle, it can offer children a more peaceful and relaxed atmosphere, and it can help to create strong family ties. Therefore, I believe that children should be encouraged to grow up in the countryside.

Competition and cooperation are two essential elements of any successful society. While some people believe that competition should be encouraged in children to foster a sense of ambition and drive, others argue that teaching children to cooperate rather than compete is more beneficial for their development. This essay will discuss both views and will provide a personal opinion.

Competition has been a part of human nature since the dawn of time. Encouraging it in children can help them to develop important skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and strategic planning. It can also help them to become more ambitious and driven, thus helping them to achieve their goals. Furthermore, children who are taught to compete from an early age are more likely to be successful in their future endeavors.

On the other hand, cooperation is also an important part of any society. Teaching children to cooperate rather than compete can help them to develop important social skills such as communication, negotiation and collaboration. Cooperation can also help children to understand the importance of working together and can help them to become more empathetic towards others. In addition, cooperation can help children to build strong relationships with their peers, which is essential for their personal growth.

In my opinion, both competition and cooperation are important for the development of children. While competition can help children to develop important skills and become more ambitious, cooperation can help them to develop social skills and build strong relationships with their peers. Therefore, I believe that both competition and cooperation should be encouraged in children in order to foster a balanced development.

When it comes to children engaging in paid work, opinions are divided. On one hand, some people view it as completely wrong and a form of exploitation, while on the other hand, others consider it to be a valuable work experience and an important part of learning and taking responsibility. In my opinion, there are both pros and cons to this issue.

On the one hand, there are several advantages to children engaging in paid work. Firstly, it can help them to develop important skills such as time management, communication, and problem-solving, which are essential for their future career and life. Secondly, it can provide them with a sense of responsibility and help them to become more independent. Lastly, it can also be a great way for them to earn money and gain financial independence.

On the other hand, there are some potential drawbacks to children engaging in paid work. Firstly, it can be dangerous for children to engage in certain types of work, such as construction or factory work, which may be hazardous. Secondly, it can be detrimental to their physical and mental health if they are working long hours and not getting enough rest. Lastly, it can also take away from their educational development, as they may be too tired to focus on their studies.

In conclusion, I believe that there are both pros and cons to children engaging in paid work. It can be beneficial in terms of helping them to develop important skills and providing them with a sense of responsibility, but it can also be detrimental to their physical and mental health if not done in moderation. Therefore, it is important to ensure that any work done by children is safe and appropriate for their age, and that they are given adequate rest and time to focus on their studies.

The number of overweight children in developed countries has been steadily increasing in recent years. This is a worrying trend, and there is much debate over the causes of this issue. Some people point to the growing number of fast food outlets as the root cause, while others blame the parents for not taking enough responsibility for their children's health. In my opinion, both of these views have some merit and should be taken into consideration.

On the one hand, it is hard to deny that the proliferation of fast food outlets has played a role in the increasing number of overweight children. Fast food is generally high in fat and sugar, and can be a very unhealthy choice for children. Furthermore, fast food outlets often market their products to children, making it even more difficult for parents to ensure their children are eating healthily. Therefore, it is clear that the growing number of fast food outlets has had a negative impact on the health of children in developed countries.

On the other hand, it is important to remember that parents are ultimately responsible for the health of their children. If parents are not making healthy food choices for their children, or not encouraging them to exercise, then this can lead to children becoming overweight. In addition, parents should be aware of the potential dangers of fast food and ensure their children are not consuming too much of it. Therefore, it is fair to say that the parents should take some responsibility for the health of their children.

In conclusion, while I believe that the growing number of fast food outlets has had an impact on the number of overweight children in developed countries, it is also important to recognize that parents should be doing more to ensure their children's health. Both of these views should be taken into consideration in order to address this worrying trend.

It is often argued that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. While parents certainly play an important role in a child's academic success, I believe that classmates can be a more powerful influence.

First of all, classmates can help motivate a child to excel in school. Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator for children, who are often eager to fit in with their peers and gain their approval. For example, if all of a child's classmates are doing well in school, the child may feel compelled to do the same in order to keep up with the group. In contrast, if a child's parents are not particularly invested in their academic success, the child may not feel as much pressure to perform well.

In addition, classmates can provide a child with valuable learning opportunities. When children are surrounded by peers who are equally or more knowledgeable than they are, they are able to learn from each other and benefit from the collective knowledge of the group. This can be especially helpful in areas such as math and science, where it can be difficult for parents to provide the same level of instruction as a qualified teacher.

Finally, classmates can provide a child with emotional support. Having a close-knit group of friends can help a child feel more secure and confident in school, which may lead to better academic performance. Friends can help each other through difficult times and provide encouragement when needed. In contrast, parents may not always be available to provide emotional support and may not have the same level of understanding as a peer.

In conclusion, while parents certainly play an important role in a child's academic success, I believe that classmates can be an even more powerful influence. Classmates can provide motivation, learning opportunities, and emotional support, all of which are essential for a child's success in school.

In recent times, the world has become increasingly interconnected and more people are travelling abroad for work and leisure. In such a globalized environment, the ability to speak a foreign language has become a necessity for many. As such, I agree that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. 

First of all, introducing children to a foreign language at an early age makes it easier for them to learn. At a young age, children’s brains are more malleable and they are able to pick up languages more quickly and easily than adults. As such, they are able to master the language in a shorter amount of time, which would be beneficial when they become adults and need to use the language in their professional and personal lives. 

Furthermore, learning a foreign language can help to open the door to a world of cultural understanding. By learning a foreign language, children are exposed to a new culture and can gain insight into the customs, traditions, and beliefs of other people. This can help to foster a greater appreciation and understanding of different cultures and promote world peace. 

Finally, learning a foreign language can help to enhance children’s cognitive abilities. Research has shown that learning a foreign language can help to improve problem-solving skills and memory. It can also help to improve communication skills and increase confidence in speaking. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. This will help to make it easier for them to learn the language, open the door to cultural understanding, and enhance their cognitive abilities.

Education is an essential part of a person’s life, and the age at which a child should begin their formal education is a hotly debated topic. Some people believe that children should begin their formal education at a very early age, and should spend most of their time on school studies. Others, however, believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. 

In my opinion, children should begin their formal education at an early age, but should also have ample time to play. This is because formal education provides children with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in life, and playtime helps them to develop social and emotional skills. 

Formal education is important for children as it provides them with the fundamental skills and knowledge required to excel in life. For example, an education in maths and science can help children to understand the world around them and to apply their knowledge to everyday life. Furthermore, formal education helps children to develop important skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, and communication. All of these skills can help children to excel in their future careers. 

On the other hand, playtime is also important for children as it helps them to develop social and emotional skills. Through play, children learn how to interact with others, how to manage their emotions, and how to negotiate with others. Playtime also helps children to develop their motor skills and imagination, which can help them to become more creative and independent thinkers. 

In conclusion, I believe that children should begin their formal education at an early age, but should also have ample time to play. Formal education provides children with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in life, and playtime helps them to develop social and emotional skills. By striking a balance between formal education and playtime, children can develop into well-rounded and successful individuals.

Education is an integral part of a child’s development, and the debate surrounding whether children should be educated at home by their parents has been ongoing for a while. While some may argue that children should not be educated at home by their parents, I believe that this can be beneficial depending on the circumstances.

On one hand, there are several advantages to this arrangement. For instance, when a child is educated at home, they can learn at their own pace and have the freedom to explore their interests more deeply. This type of education also allows the child to be in a comfortable and familiar environment, which can be beneficial for their mental wellbeing. Furthermore, parents can tailor their child’s education to their individual needs and interests, which can lead to a more engaging and inspiring learning experience.

On the other hand, there are a number of disadvantages to this arrangement. For example, children who are educated at home may miss out on the social interaction of attending school with peers. This can lead to a lack of confidence and social skills, which can be detrimental to their development. Furthermore, parents may not have the necessary knowledge or qualifications to provide the best education for their child, which could lead to gaps in their learning. Additionally, parents may not be able to provide the same level of resources that a school can, such as access to specialist teachers and equipment.

In conclusion, while there are both advantages and disadvantages to educating children at home by their parents, I believe that this can be beneficial depending on the circumstances. Parents should ensure that they are able to provide the best education for their child and that they are aware of the potential risks.

Nowadays, the lifestyle and eating habits of children have changed drastically, compared to the previous generations. Some people believe that this has had a negative effect on the health of children. In my opinion, this opinion is partially true, as there are both positive and negative impacts of these changes on the health of children.

On the one hand, there are numerous advantages of the altered lifestyle and eating habits of children. Firstly, due to the availability of a variety of food items, children are now exposed to a wider range of nutritional options. This helps them in developing healthier eating habits and a balanced diet. Secondly, the availability of technology has enabled children to stay indoors and engage in physical activities like yoga and aerobics, which are beneficial for their health.

On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks of the changed lifestyle and eating habits of children. Firstly, the increased consumption of fast food, which contains unhealthy amounts of fat, sugar and salt, is a major concern. This has resulted in an increase in the number of children suffering from obesity and other health-related issues. Secondly, children spend most of their time indoors, playing video games or watching television, which leads to a lack of physical activity. This makes them prone to various health problems.

To conclude, I believe that the changed lifestyle and eating habits of children have both positive and negative impacts on their health. It is therefore essential that parents and teachers take necessary steps to ensure that children are exposed to a balanced diet and engage in physical activities. This will help in maintaining the health of children and ensuring their overall well-being.

I disagree with the statement that people should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. I believe that people should read a variety of books, including those that are about fiction, in order to gain a more complete understanding of the world.

First of all, reading fiction allows people to explore ideas, emotions, and situations that may not be present in real life. Through reading fiction, people can gain a greater insight into the human condition, and explore different perspectives and possibilities. For example, reading dystopian novels can help people to understand the consequences of certain political and social decisions, and to consider alternate paths that could be taken. Fiction also allows people to escape from the real world, and to explore different settings and characters.

In addition, reading fiction can help people to develop empathy and understanding. By reading about characters that are different from themselves, people can gain a better understanding of the struggles and experiences of others. This can help people to become more compassionate and understanding of those around them.

Finally, reading fiction can help people to become better writers. By reading different types of stories, people can learn how to better structure their own stories and develop their own writing style.

In conclusion, I believe that people should read a variety of books, including those that are about fiction, in order to gain a more complete understanding of the world.

Disruptive school students can have a negative influence on their peers and the learning environment, and it is understandable that many people may think that these students should be grouped together and taught separately. However, I disagree with this solution.

Rather than separating disruptive students from the rest of the student body, I believe that the best option is to provide them with additional support and guidance. This could take the form of one-on-one tutoring, counselling, or other forms of intervention. By providing these students with the necessary support, they can learn how to better manage their behaviour and be better equipped to learn in a regular classroom setting.

Separating disruptive students from the rest of the student body could have a negative impact on their self-esteem and social development. Without the opportunity to interact with their peers, they may become isolated and feel like they are being punished for their behaviour.

The trend of replacing sports and exercise classes with academic subjects has been gaining traction in many countries. While this shift may be beneficial in some ways, it can also have some negative effects.

On the positive side, replacing sports and exercise classes with academic subjects can help students acquire more knowledge and skills. Students can learn more about a variety of topics, such as mathematics, science, and history, which can help them become more well-rounded and knowledgeable. Additionally, it can help them develop critical thinking skills, as they will have to analyze and interpret information. Furthermore, this shift can help students become more competitive in the job market, as employers often prefer applicants with a wide range of knowledge and skills.

On the other hand, replacing sports and exercise classes with academic subjects can have some negative effects. For example, students may become more stressed and anxious, as they are required to learn more material in a shorter period of time. Furthermore, they may become less physically active, which can have negative health implications.

The debate over whether universities should focus more on theoretical knowledge or practical training has been a long-standing one. While some people argue that universities should focus more on practical training, I completely disagree with this opinion.

Firstly, theoretical knowledge is essential for any student. It is the foundation of a student’s education and provides the student with the necessary skills and knowledge to understand and analyze more complex topics. Without a strong theoretical background, students will not be able to understand the practical applications of their education. Moreover, theoretical knowledge allows students to think critically and develop their own opinions on a wide range of topics.

Secondly, practical training is important but it should not be the primary focus of university education. Practical training should be used to supplement theoretical knowledge, not replace it. Practical training allows students to apply what they have learned in the classroom to real-world scenarios. However, if universities focus too much on practical training, students may lack the knowledge and skills to develop innovative solutions to complex problems.

Lastly, universities should strive to provide a balanced education that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical training. This will ensure that students are well-rounded and prepared for the real world. Moreover, universities should provide students with opportunities to gain hands-on experience through internships and other activities. This will help students to gain a better understanding of the practical applications of their education.

In conclusion, universities should not focus solely on practical training but should provide a balanced education that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical training. This will ensure that students have the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the real world.

I disagree with the statement that students who study from school to university get less benefit and contribute less than those of students who go to travel or get a job and gain skills and experience before going to higher education. I believe that a student who studies from school to university can gain a lot of benefits and contribute more than those of students who travel or work.

First of all, students who study from school to university have the opportunity to gain knowledge and skills in a structured and organized way. They can learn the basics of a subject and then expand their knowledge and skills as they progress through their studies. This is something that students who travel or work cannot do. They may gain experience and skills from their travels or jobs, but they are not able to learn the basics of a subject and build on that knowledge.

Second, students who study from school to university can also gain valuable connections and networks. They can meet people from different backgrounds and cultures, which can help them build a strong network of contacts that can be beneficial for their future. Students who travel or work may not have the opportunity to meet people and build such a strong network.

Finally, students who study from school to university can also benefit from the resources available to them. They can access libraries, laboratories, and other resources that can help them learn more and develop new skills. Students who travel or work may not have access to such resources.

In conclusion, I believe that students who study from school to university can gain more benefits and contribute more than those of students who travel or work. They can learn the basics of a subject, build a strong network of contacts, and access resources that can help them develop new skills.

In this day and age, the trend of sending children to study overseas has become increasingly popular. This is mainly due to the fact that the cost of international education has dropped dramatically in recent years, making it more accessible to the general public. On the other hand, there are those who are critical of this trend. They argue that the cons outweigh the pros, citing the potential for language barriers, cultural clashes, and the homesickness of the students.

While these are valid concerns, I believe that the pros of sending children to study abroad far outweigh the cons. Firstly, international education provides students with a unique opportunity to experience different cultures, which can help them to become more open-minded and tolerant of others. Furthermore, it allows them to gain a more global perspective on the world, and to develop a better understanding of international affairs. Secondly, overseas education can give students a competitive edge in the job market, as employers are increasingly looking for employees with international experience. Finally, the language and academic skills they acquire while studying abroad will give them an advantage when competing with other students for university places and job opportunities.

In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of sending children to study abroad far outweigh the potential drawbacks. The experience of living and studying in a different country can be invaluable for students, as it can help them to gain a better understanding of the world, and to acquire the skills necessary to succeed in their future careers.

I disagree with the idea that non-academic subjects should be removed from the school syllabus in order to help young people succeed academically. I believe that these subjects are just as important for a well-rounded education and can be beneficial to a student's academic success.

Firstly, non-academic subjects such as physical education and cookery can provide students with the opportunity to learn important life skills. Physical education teaches students about the importance of exercise and the benefits of leading a healthy lifestyle, while cookery teaches students how to prepare nutritious meals. These skills are invaluable for young people and can help them to maintain a healthy balance between work and play, which can improve their academic performance.

Secondly, non-academic subjects can also provide students with a much needed break from their academic studies. This can help to reduce stress and give them a chance to relax and recharge, which can improve their concentration and focus when they return to their studies. Furthermore, it can also provide students with an opportunity to explore their interests and passions, which can help to motivate them to work harder in their academic studies.

Finally, non-academic subjects can also help to improve the overall school experience for students. These subjects can provide students with a sense of belonging and a chance to make friends and socialize, which can help to make school a more enjoyable and rewarding experience.

In conclusion, I believe that non-academic subjects should not be removed from the school syllabus as they can provide students with important life skills, a chance to relax, and an opportunity to explore their interests. These benefits can ultimately help to improve a student's academic performance.

On the one hand, there are many advantages to taking a break from formal education and travelling or working for a period of time. Firstly, it can provide a valuable opportunity to gain life experience and to gain a better understanding of the world. Travelling can broaden one’s horizons, giving the opportunity to learn about different cultures, meet people from different backgrounds, and gain a deeper understanding of the world. Working can also provide similar benefits, as it can teach valuable skills such as discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving. In addition, taking a break from formal education can provide a chance to take a break from studying, and to explore different interests and hobbies.

In conclusion, both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the decision should be based on the individual’s needs and preferences. For some, taking a break from formal education may be the best way to gain life experience and explore different interests. However, for others, going directly to university may be the best option, as it can provide a more structured path to a successful career. Ultimately, it is important to consider the pros and cons of both approaches before making a decision.

The growth of telecommuting is a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly popular in many countries across the world. It is expected that in the coming decades, telecommuting will be the norm for most office workers. This shift in the way people work will undoubtedly have a profound effect on society as a whole.

One of the most obvious effects of telecommuting will be a reduction in the number of people commuting to and from their workplace every day. This will result in less traffic congestion on the roads, as well as a reduction in the amount of pollution created by cars and other vehicles. This will lead to improved air quality and a healthier environment for everyone. Furthermore, with fewer people commuting, there will be less need for large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the construction of new roads and bridges.

Another benefit of telecommuting is that it will enable people to have more flexibility in their work schedule. This will be especially beneficial for parents, who will be able to work from home while also taking care of their children. Additionally, telecommuting will allow people to live in more rural areas, where housing costs are typically lower than in urban areas.

On the other hand, there are some potential drawbacks to telecommuting. For example, it may be difficult for some people to stay motivated and productive when working from home. Furthermore, it could lead to a decrease in face-to-face interaction with colleagues, which could result in a lack of collaboration and teamwork. Finally, if telecommuting becomes the norm, it could lead to job losses in certain sectors, such as retail and hospitality, as fewer people are needed to provide services to customers.

In conclusion, the growth of telecommuting will undoubtedly have a significant impact on society. While there are some potential drawbacks, the advantages are likely to outweigh them. If managed properly, telecommuting could lead to a healthier environment, more flexibility in work schedules, and lower housing costs.

The internet has become a primary source of information for many people in today's world. It is a valuable tool for researching topics, finding news, and staying connected with friends and family. However, it is important to recognize that there are drawbacks to using the internet as a source of information. In this essay, I will argue that the drawbacks of using the internet as a source of information outweigh the advantages. 

One major drawback of using the internet as a source of information is the lack of accuracy. With the vast amount of information available on the internet, it can be difficult to determine which sources are reliable and which are not. This can lead to the spread of false information and inaccurate conclusions. For example, some websites may present biased or incomplete information, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. Additionally, anyone can post information on the internet, which can lead to the spread of false information. 

Another drawback of using the internet as a source of information is the potential for cyberbullying. With the ease of access to the internet, cyberbullying has become a serious problem. Cyberbullying can have a devastating effect on both the bully and the victim, leading to depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Additionally, cyberbullying can lead to the spread of malicious rumors and false information, which can be damaging to a person's reputation. 

Finally, using the internet as a source of information can lead to addiction. With the wide variety of content available, it can be easy to become addicted to the internet. This can lead to a decrease in productivity, as people spend more time online than they do completing tasks. Additionally, addiction to the internet can lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can lead to various health problems. 

In conclusion, the drawbacks of using the internet as a source of information outweigh the advantages. It is important to be aware of the potential risks of using the internet as a source of information, and to take steps to ensure that the information we are accessing is accurate and reliable.

The rising levels of congestion and air pollution found in most of the world's cities can be attributed directly to the rapidly increasing number of private cars in use. This is because private cars are a major source of air pollution, and the increase in their numbers has led to a decrease in the quality of life in cities. In order to reverse this decline, it is necessary to encourage people to use public transport more and their cars less.

One way to encourage the use of public transport is to make it more affordable. Governments can reduce fares for public transport, making it more accessible to people of all income levels. This could be done through subsidies or tax credits, or by providing special discounts for certain groups, such as students or the elderly. In addition, governments can invest in public transport infrastructure, such as buses and trains, to make it more reliable and efficient. This would make public transport a more attractive option for people who are looking for a convenient way to get around.

Another way to encourage the use of public transport is to make it more convenient. Governments can provide incentives for people to use public transport, such as free Wi-Fi or charging stations on buses and trains. This would make public transport a more attractive option for people who need to stay connected while they are on the go. In addition, governments can make public transport more accessible by providing better schedules and routes, and by making sure that there is adequate coverage in areas where public transport is lacking.

Finally, governments can also encourage the use of public transport by making it safer. This can be done by increasing security on public transport vehicles and at stations, and by introducing measures such as CCTV cameras and regular patrols. This would make people feel more secure when using public transport, and make it a more attractive option.

In conclusion, there are a number of ways that governments can encourage people to use public transport more and their cars less. This is necessary in order to reduce congestion and air pollution in cities, and to improve the quality of life for those who live there.

The statement that computers will soon replace teachers in the classroom is an oversimplification of the role of technology in education. In reality, computers are being used to supplement the teaching process, not replace it. The use of computers in education provides a number of benefits, such as allowing students to access a wealth of digital resources, use interactive multimedia tools, and even collaborate with peers online. However, despite the advantages of technology, it is the teacher who ultimately provides the guidance and support necessary for students to learn effectively.

Teachers are essential for providing students with personalized instruction and feedback. They are able to tailor instructions to the individual needs of their students, as well as provide direct feedback and guidance. For example, a teacher can quickly identify when a student is struggling with a particular concept and provide individualized support. Computers, on the other hand, are not able to provide the same level of personalized instruction.

In addition, teachers are also able to create a positive learning environment in the classroom. They can foster collaboration, encourage critical thinking, and motivate students to reach their full potential.

Books and experience are both excellent sources of knowledge, but the importance of each depends on the context. Knowledge gained from books is often theoretical and can provide a broad overview of a subject, while knowledge gained from experience is more practical and can provide a deeper understanding of a topic.

Books are a great way to learn about a wide variety of topics. They can provide a comprehensive overview of a subject, as well as an in-depth look at specific aspects. Books can also provide valuable insights into the history and context of a subject. This information can be used to better understand the subject and make more informed decisions.

Experience is also a great source of knowledge. Through experience, we can learn by doing. We can gain a more practical understanding of a subject by actually engaging with it.

On the other hand, experience gives us the chance to apply what we have learned from books and to gain a deeper understanding of the world. Both sources of knowledge are important in their own ways and can provide us with valuable insights.

When it comes to deciding which source of knowledge is more important, it depends on the context. For example, if someone is studying for an exam, knowledge gained from books is likely to be more important as it will provide them with the facts and figures they need to pass the exam. However, if someone is trying to gain a better understanding of the world, knowledge gained from experience is likely to be more important. This is because experience allows us to apply our knowledge in real-world situations and gain a deeper understanding of the world.

In my opinion, both sources of knowledge are equally important. Books provide us with the facts and figures we need to understand the world, while experience allows us to apply what we have learned and gain a deeper understanding of the world. Without books, we would not have access to the knowledge we need to understand the world, and without experience, we would not be able to apply our knowledge in real-world situations. Therefore, both sources of knowledge are essential in learning.

School drop-outs are a major issue in many countries around the world. Every year, thousands of students choose to leave school without completing their studies. This is a major problem, as it can result in lower educational attainment, reduced job opportunities and a lack of financial security in the future. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why students drop out of school and suggest possible solutions to this problem.

One of the most common reasons for students leaving school is financial difficulty. Many students and their families cannot afford the costs associated with attending school, such as textbooks, uniforms and transportation. In addition, some students may be forced to work in order to support their families and can no longer commit to their studies. Another factor is the lack of motivation or interest in the curriculum. If students are not engaged in the learning process or find the material to be uninteresting, they may be more likely to drop out.

To address the issue of school drop-outs, there are a number of possible solutions. One way to reduce the financial burden of attending school is to provide scholarships and grants to students in need. This would allow more students to continue their studies without worrying about the financial implications. In addition, schools should strive to create an engaging and stimulating learning environment. This can be done by introducing more interactive and hands-on activities, as well as providing more individualized instruction. Finally, schools should provide more support services, such as counseling and mentoring, to help students who are struggling with their studies.

In conclusion, school drop-outs are a major problem in many countries around the world. The reasons for this include financial difficulty, lack of motivation and disinterest in the curriculum. To solve this problem, schools should provide more financial support, create engaging learning environments and offer more support services. By taking these steps, schools can help to ensure that more students are able to complete their studies and reach their full potential.

In today’s competitive world, having a university education is seen as a key to success in life. It is widely believed that having a degree is essential to achieving success in the professional world. However, while a university education can open doors to many opportunities, there are other factors that can lead to success in life. 

First and foremost, a university education can equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the professional world. Students learn important skills such as critical thinking, problem solving and communication, which can help them get ahead in their chosen field. Additionally, a university education can provide students with access to a variety of resources and networks that can help them succeed. For example, universities often have career centers that can provide students with job opportunities and internships. 

However, a university education is not the only path to success. Many people achieve success in life without a university degree. For example, some successful entrepreneurs have achieved success without a degree. Similarly, some people are able to use their skills and talents to become successful without a degree. Furthermore, many successful people have achieved success by learning through experience rather than through formal education. 

In conclusion, while a university education can open up many opportunities, it is not the only path to success. There are many other factors that can lead to success such as hard work, determination and the ability to learn from experience. Ultimately, success depends on the individual and their willingness to work hard and seize opportunities.

Education is the cornerstone of any successful society. It is the foundation on which knowledge and skills are built, and it is the basis from which individuals can grow and develop. Unfortunately, in today's society, it seems that education is losing its value.

One of the main reasons for this is the growing prevalence of technology. With the advent of computers and the internet, it is now possible to access information more quickly and easily than ever before. This has led to a decrease in the importance of traditional educational methods, such as attending classes or reading textbooks. Instead, people are relying more and more on technology to provide them with the knowledge they need.

Another reason why education is losing its value is the increasing cost of higher education. College tuition fees are rising faster than ever before, and many students are unable to afford the cost. This has led to a decrease in the number of people attending college, and a decrease in the value of a college degree.

Finally, the growing popularity of online education has also contributed to the devaluation of traditional education. Online courses are often cheaper and more convenient than attending physical classes, and they offer students the opportunity to learn at their own pace. However, this has led to a decrease in the value of a traditional degree, as employers are becoming less likely to hire someone with an online degree.

Overall, it is clear that education is losing its value in today's society. Technology has made it easier for people to access information, and the increasing cost of higher education has made it more difficult for students to attend college. Additionally, the popularity of online education has led to a decrease in the value of traditional degrees. If this trend continues, it could have a serious impact on the future of education.

I agree that schools should teach more practical matters such as home management, work, and interpersonal skills. Academic subjects are important, but there are many skills that cannot be learned from textbooks, and having knowledge of how to manage a home, work, and interact with others can be invaluable in the future.

First of all, home management is a skill that is often overlooked in school, but it is important to know how to take care of a home, from budgeting to cleaning. Knowing how to budget and manage finances, as well as how to clean and maintain a home, are important skills that are not always taught in school. Learning these skills can be beneficial in the long run, as they can help individuals become more independent and successful in their lives.

Secondly, work skills are also important and should be taught in school. Knowing how to work in a team, communicate effectively, and solve problems are all important skills that are not always taught in school. These skills are essential for success in the workplace and can help individuals become more successful in their careers.

Finally, interpersonal skills are also important and should be taught in school. Knowing how to interact with others, build relationships, and resolve conflicts are all important skills that are not always taught in school. These skills can help individuals become more successful in their lives, both professionally and personally.

In conclusion, I believe that schools should teach more practical matters such as home management, work, and interpersonal skills. These skills are essential for success in the future, and can help individuals become more successful in their lives.

Books and life experience are two sources of knowledge, but each has its own unique advantages. Books provide a vast array of information and knowledge that can be used to gain understanding of a variety of topics, while life experience can provide a more personal and in-depth understanding of a particular subject. 

Books are one of the most important sources of knowledge. They provide a wealth of information and knowledge that can be used to gain understanding of a variety of topics. Books can also be used to expand one's understanding of a particular subject. Books provide readers with the opportunity to explore a topic in greater detail, to gain insight into the history and development of a subject, and to gain an understanding of the current state of knowledge. 

On the other hand, life experience can provide a more personal and in-depth understanding of a particular subject. Through life experience, one can gain a more comprehensive understanding of a subject by engaging with it in a more direct and personal way. This can include engaging in hands-on activities, interacting with people, and experiencing the environment in which the subject is situated. Life experience can also provide a more nuanced understanding of a subject, as one can gain insight into the complexities of the subject and understand the nuances of the different perspectives.

In my opinion, both sources of knowledge are equally important.

Nowadays, environmental problems are becoming increasingly prominent and have become an important topic of discussion around the world. It is true that these environmental issues are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. This is because environmental problems, such as global warming, air pollution, and water pollution, are issues that affect all countries, regardless of their size or location. Therefore, it is essential that the international community takes collective action to address these issues.

I agree that environmental issues are an international problem and must be addressed on a global scale. If individual persons or countries try to tackle environmental problems without the help of other countries, the results are likely to be limited. For example, if one country implements measures to reduce air pollution, but other countries do not, then the air pollution problem will not be solved. Therefore, it is important that all countries work together to find solutions to environmental problems.

Furthermore, many environmental issues are caused by activities that take place in one country but have an impact on another. For instance, air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels in one country can drift across borders and affect the air quality in other countries. This highlights the need for international cooperation to protect the environment.

In conclusion, I agree that environmental problems are an international problem and require collective action from the international community. Without this, it is unlikely that environmental issues can be effectively addressed.

In today's world, we are producing more and more rubbish. This phenomenon is due to several factors. Firstly, people have become more dependent on disposable products, such as plastic containers, paper cups and plastic bags. These products are convenient and inexpensive, but they are not biodegradable and can accumulate in landfills for centuries. Secondly, the population is growing rapidly and this means more people are using more products and generating more waste. Finally, the production of goods has increased dramatically due to globalisation and the industrialisation of many countries.

There are several measures that governments can take to reduce the amount of rubbish produced. Firstly, they can introduce legislation that requires manufacturers to use recyclable materials and eco-friendly packaging. This will reduce the amount of non-recyclable waste that is produced. Secondly, governments can introduce incentives for people to reduce their consumption of disposable products and encourage them to use reusable items instead. Finally, governments can invest in waste management systems, such as composting and recycling facilities, to ensure that the waste that is produced is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.

In conclusion, the amount of rubbish produced is increasing due to several factors. Governments must take action to reduce the amount of rubbish produced by introducing legislation, incentives and waste management systems.

Climate change is an issue that is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Scientists and the news media are providing more and more evidence that climate change is a real and present danger. While governments must take responsibility for their part in this global problem, individuals must also take responsibility for their own actions.

I believe that individuals have a responsibility to change their lifestyles in order to help prevent further damage to our planet. This could mean anything from reducing the amount of energy and water we use, to limiting our consumption of products that require a lot of resources to produce. In addition to this, individuals can help by reducing the amount of waste they produce, by recycling and reusing items instead of throwing them away. By making these small changes to our lifestyles, we can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and therefore help to slow down the progress of climate change.

At the same time, governments must also do their part in tackling this global problem. This could mean introducing legislation to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released by industry, or investing in renewable energy sources. Governments can also provide incentives for individuals to make more sustainable choices, such as offering tax credits for purchasing energy efficient appliances or providing grants to help people install solar panels.

In conclusion, I believe that both individuals and governments have a responsibility to help tackle the problem of climate change. Individuals must take responsibility for their own actions and strive to make more sustainable choices, while governments must provide the necessary support and incentives to help individuals make these changes. Only by working together can we hope to reduce the effects of climate change and protect our planet for future generations.

One of the most important natural resources that is quickly disappearing is clean water. Clean water is essential for life, and without it, humans and animals alike are unable to survive. In some parts of the world, access to clean water is already limited, and the situation is only getting worse. Therefore, it is important to take action to protect clean water and ensure that it is available for future generations.

One of the main reasons why clean water needs to be saved is that it is essential for human health. When people drink contaminated water, they can get sick and even die from water-borne illnesses. In some parts of the world, access to clean water is already limited, and people are forced to drink contaminated water, resulting in a higher rate of diseases. Furthermore, clean water is necessary for proper hygiene, which can help reduce the spread of diseases. Therefore, it is essential that we protect clean water and make sure it is available for everyone.

Another reason why clean water needs to be saved is that it is essential for sustaining life on the planet. All living things need water to survive, and when clean water is not available, it can have a devastating effect on the environment. For example, when rivers and streams become contaminated, it can cause the death of fish and other aquatic life. This can lead to a disruption of the food chain and have a negative impact on the entire ecosystem. Therefore, it is important to protect clean water and ensure that it is available for all living things.

In conclusion, clean water is an important natural resource that is quickly disappearing. It is essential for human health, as well as for sustaining life on the planet. Therefore, it is important to take action to protect clean water and make sure it is available for future generations.

The earth is indeed being filled with waste material such as plastic bags and other rubbish. This is an alarming situation since it is causing serious environmental damage. The accumulation of plastic waste is having a devastating effect on marine life, with many species of fish and other animals ingesting plastic particles. Moreover, plastic waste is also contributing to global warming, as it is not biodegradable and can take centuries to decompose. 

Fortunately, there are ways to address this problem. One of the most effective solutions is to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is produced in the first place. This can be done by encouraging people to use reusable bags and containers instead of disposable plastic ones. Additionally, governments can impose taxes and fees on single-use plastics and other forms of waste. This would not only discourage people from using disposable plastics, but also generate funds for recycling and waste management programs. 

Another solution is to increase public awareness about the dangers of plastic waste. This can be done through campaigns and educational programs that emphasize the importance of recycling and proper waste disposal. Furthermore, governments should also invest in technologies that can help reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment. For example, they can support initiatives that focus on developing biodegradable plastics or technologies that can break down plastic waste into its component molecules. 

In conclusion, the earth is indeed being filled with plastic waste and other rubbish. However, there are solutions to this problem, such as reducing the amount of plastic waste produced, increasing public awareness, and investing in new technologies. If we take the necessary steps, we can reduce the amount of plastic waste and protect our environment.

The debate of whether to preserve past historical buildings is an ongoing one. On one hand, some argue that it is important to preserve these buildings as they are a reminder of our past and can be used to educate future generations about our history. On the other hand, some argue that it is more important to focus on the present and future and use the resources to build something more modern and efficient. In my opinion, we should preserve past historical buildings as they are an important part of our history and culture.

The preservation of past historical buildings is important as they are a reminder of our past and can be used to educate future generations about our history. These buildings are a physical representation of our culture, and they can help us to understand the struggles and achievements of the people who lived in the past. For example, the Great Wall of China is a reminder of the efforts of the Chinese people to defend their borders, and it is an important part of Chinese history. Similarly, the Taj Mahal in India is a reminder of the love of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife, and it is an important part of Indian culture.

Preserving past historical buildings also helps to create a sense of identity and belonging. These buildings are a physical reminder of our history, and they can help to create a sense of pride and belonging among the people who live in the area. For example, the ancient city of Rome is a reminder of the great Roman Empire, and it is a source of pride for the Italian people. Similarly, the ancient city of Jerusalem is a reminder of the Jewish people’s connection to the land, and it is a source of pride for the Jewish people.

Finally, preserving past historical buildings can help to attract tourists and generate revenue. These buildings are often considered to be tourist attractions, and they can help to generate revenue for the local economy. For example, the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii are a popular tourist destination, and they generate a significant amount of revenue for the Italian economy. Similarly, the Great Wall of China is a popular tourist destination, and it generates a significant amount of revenue for the Chinese economy.

In conclusion, I believe that we should preserve past historical buildings as they are an important part of our history and culture.

Communication is an essential part of our lives, and the media we use to communicate information has a significant impact on how the message is received. In this essay, I will compare the advantages and disadvantages of three communication mediums: comics, books, and radio.

Comics are a popular form of communication, particularly among younger people. They are an effective way to communicate information, as they can be both entertaining and informative. On the other hand, comics are often seen as less serious than other forms of media, and the messages they convey may not always be taken seriously.

Books are a more traditional form of communication, and they are often seen as a more serious and reliable source of information. They are also more detailed than comics and can convey complex information in an easy to understand manner. However, books can be time consuming to read and require a more dedicated audience.

Radio is a powerful medium for communication, as it can reach a wide audience in a short amount of time. It is also relatively inexpensive to produce, and it can be used to communicate a variety of messages. On the other hand, radio can be difficult to control and can be easily interrupted or distorted.

In my opinion, books are the most effective medium for communicating information. They are the most reliable source of information, as they are more detailed and require more dedication from the reader. Additionally, books can be used to convey complex information in an easy to understand manner, making them an effective way to communicate.

News editors are those in charge of deciding what to broadcast on television, radio, and print in newspapers. In most cases, news editors are responsible for collecting news stories, writing headlines, and having stories ready for when the news broadcast goes live. With the vast plethora of events, happenings, and news reports from around the world, editors must make decisions that reflect their values, goals, and ideals while still being impartial and presenting the facts. 

Naturally, there is pressure when it comes to making such decisions. Editors are tasked with discerning what news is important, how to package it, and where to prioritize it in the program or issue. That isn’t to say there are no guidelines in place, as journalistic ethics such as verification of facts and informing the public with accurate information remain integral parts of news editors’ job descriptions. 

Furthermore, it is debatable as to what influences news editors’ decisions when it comes to choosing stories to print or broadcast. Depending on the circumstances, teams of editors may have more leeway in covering stories that may not carry a high degree of public interest, but nevertheless have some merit. For example, a regional story that may have significant importance for a small area could be featured. Ultimately, a number of elements—the regional news editors’ values, what the public is interested in, space and time allocated for news stories, the attention to accuracy, and more—may dictate whether a story makes the cut or not. 

In regards to whether we have become used to bad news, this can be corroborated; for instance, part of why journalists often focus on negativity is because it often grabs public attention more easily than positive stories. At the same time, it can be argued that stories with a positive spin and happy endings can provide solace and hope to people, which proves that not all stories need to come with a dark conclusion. 

Considering the matter of whether more good news should be reported, the answer is a definitive yes. By elucidating the good that happens alongside bad news, the media created a rounded narrative that provides the public with a sense of positivity in the form of encouragement. It is essential that the moral courage of society be highlighted with news stories that, even in an era as tumultuous as ours, have happy and/or productive resolutions, as this is likely to inspire a sense of hope for people around the world. 

In conclusion, news editors are faced with a multitude of decisions to make, from pressing international stories to local events, which often come with a degree of pressure and speculation as to what ultimately gets broadcast. Even with factors in play, there is evidence that good news is welcomed just as much as bad news, and there should definitely be consideration put towards reporting more positive stories, as this carries benefits to viewers and readers.

News editors are responsible for deciding what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. They are expected to select stories that will be of interest to their target audience. The factors that influence their decisions vary depending on the type of news outlet, but some of the most important considerations include the relevance of the story, its timeliness, the potential for controversy, and the potential for audience engagement. 

The media has a responsibility to report on important news stories, but it is also important that they consider the impact that their reporting may have on their viewers or readers. It is not uncommon for news outlets to focus on negative stories, as these tend to generate more attention and discussion. This can lead to an over-emphasis on negative stories, which can lead to viewers and readers becoming desensitized to bad news. 

It is important that news outlets also report on positive stories, as this can help to counterbalance the negative stories and provide viewers and readers with a more balanced view of the world. Positive stories can help to provide hope in difficult times and can help to inspire people to take action and make a difference. Positive stories can also help to reduce feelings of helplessness and isolation by showing that there are people out there who are working hard to make the world a better place.

Parents are often considered to be the best teachers due to the bond of trust and understanding that exists between them and their children. There is no doubt that this connection helps children learn better, as the parent is less likely to be judgmental and is able to provide helpful guidance and support. This essay will discuss reasons why parents are the best teachers before providing examples to illustrate the points. 

The majority of parents have a wide range of life experiences that they can share with their children. This gives children a valuable opportunity to learn from the mistakes and successes of their parents, who can use their own experiences as a source of advice to prepare their children for any future challenges. By doing this, parents provide a framework to their children on how to handle situations, and give a unique perspective which allows them to better comprehend the lesson. 

Furthermore, parents are typically able to create a positive learning environment which fosters the ability to learn new skills and knowledge. Having a predictable and structured routine is essential in any learning environment, and with parents, children have the assurance that someone will always be there to provide guidance and support when needed. Additionally, the atmosphere at home allows children to practice what they have been taught in a comfortable and safe environment away from the pressures of a traditional classroom. 

In addition, parents have a certain level of understanding when it comes to their children, making it easier for them to identify and manage any learning difficulties their child may have. The parent-child bond gives parents a rare insight into their child’s learning process and how children react to new concepts, allowing them to modify their teaching style to better help their child. This level of knowledge and understanding is generally heightened when it comes to parents, and is not commonly found with an outside teacher. 

To illustrate, my parents were my main source of education when I was younger. I was surrounded by books and learning materials which gave me the guidance I needed. Furthermore, they provided me with a positive learning atmosphere which allowed me to practice what I had learnt in a comfortable environment. Lastly, they had an intimate understanding of me, which enabled them to adjust their teaching style and ensure understanding and progress. 

In conclusion, parents are often the best teachers due to the unique combination of life experience, positive learning environment, and parental understanding that they possess. This provides a unique teaching style that can be tailored to the individual learning process of their children. For these reasons, it is clear that parents are the best teachers.

Parents are often referred to as the best teachers in life, as they are the ones who are with us from the beginning and have the most influence in our formative years. While I agree that parents are some of the best teachers, I do not think that they are the only ones who can teach us valuable life lessons.

Parents are the first teachers we have in life. They teach us basic values such as respect, responsibility, and hard work. They also provide us with much of our initial education, teaching us to read and write, and helping us to understand the world around us. Moreover, parents often pass on their own values and beliefs to their children, which can shape their outlook on life.

However, parents are not the only teachers in life. We can learn from many other sources, including our peers, teachers, and even our own experiences. Our peers can teach us valuable lessons about friendship, loyalty, and teamwork. Our teachers can help us to learn new skills and to develop our knowledge. And our own experiences can help us to grow as individuals, as we learn from our mistakes and successes.

In conclusion, while parents are some of the best teachers we have in life, they are not the only ones. We can learn from many other sources, including our peers, teachers, and our own experiences.

The debate around the effects of television on children has been ongoing for many years. While some people argue that watching television is bad for children, others believe that it can have positive effects. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that watching television is bad for children.

Firstly, television can help children to learn about the world around them. Through educational programs, children can learn about different cultures, languages, and even scientific discoveries. This can help them to develop an understanding of the world beyond their own experience. Additionally, television can help children to develop their language skills. Children can learn new words and phrases from watching television, which can help them to become more confident in their communication. 

Secondly, television can provide entertainment for children. Watching television can be a fun and entertaining way for children to pass the time. It can also help children to relax after a long day at school. Television can also provide children with an opportunity to watch their favorite shows and movies, which can be a great source of joy and happiness. 

Finally, television can be a great way for children to bond with their family and friends. Watching television together can be a great way for children to spend quality time with their family and friends, which can help to strengthen relationships.

The teenage years are a crucial time in a person's life, as they are transitioning from childhood to adulthood. During this period, it is important for teenagers to learn to make their own decisions and take responsibility for their actions. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their teenage children.

To begin with, it is important for teenagers to learn how to think for themselves and make their own decisions. This is an important skill that will help them become more independent and self-reliant in the future. Making their own decisions will also help them to develop problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically. For instance, if a teenage child is considering taking up a part-time job, it is important for them to weigh the pros and cons and then make a decision for themselves.

Moreover, allowing teenagers to make their own decisions will help them to take responsibility for their actions. This is especially important when it comes to making decisions that have long term consequences, such as choosing a college or a career path. If parents or other adult relatives make these decisions for them, they may not understand the implications of their choices and may not be motivated to take responsibility for the outcomes. On the other hand, if they make their own decisions, they will be more likely to understand the consequences and will be more likely to take responsibility for their choices.

Finally, making their own decisions will help teenagers to gain confidence and learn to trust their own judgment. This is an important skill that will help them to make more informed decisions in the future. For example, if a teenage child is deciding whether or not to take a gap year, they should be allowed to make their own decision and be supported in doing so. This will help them to gain confidence in their own decisions and to trust their own judgment.

In conclusion, I disagree with the statement that parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their teenage children. It is important for teenagers to learn to make their own decisions and take responsibility for their actions. Allowing them to make their own decisions will help them to develop problem-solving skills, take responsibility for their choices, and gain confidence in their own judgment.

The debate about who makes a better parent, men or women, has been ongoing for many years. While some people argue that women make better parents than men, others claim that men are just as good as women at parenting. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of this debate and explain why I believe that both genders can make equally good parents.

On one hand, there is a strong argument that women make better parents than men. This is because women typically have a greater emotional connection with their children, which is important for their development. Women are also more patient and nurturing when it comes to raising children, which can help them to learn better and develop more positive relationships with their parents. Additionally, women often have more experience with childcare, which can give them an advantage when it comes to parenting.

On the other hand, there are also many people who believe that men can make just as good parents as women. Men are often seen as having more discipline and structure when it comes to parenting, which can help children to learn important values and life lessons. Men can also be more active in activities with their children, such as playing sports or going on outdoor adventures, which can help to create a strong bond between them. Additionally, men can provide a different perspective on parenting, which can be beneficial for children.

In conclusion, both men and women can make equally good parents. While women may have a stronger emotional connection with their children and more experience with childcare, men can provide different perspectives and be more active in activities with their children. Ultimately, it is up to individual parents to decide how they want to raise their children and which approach works best for them.

In the modern world, it is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increased prevalence of technology, the rise of the nuclear family, and the growing prevalence of individualism. 

The increased prevalence of technology has had a significant impact on the closeness of modern families. With the rise of social media, families are no longer limited to face-to-face communication as a means of staying connected. This has led to a decrease in the amount of meaningful communication and physical contact between family members. Furthermore, the prevalence of technology has also led to an increase in the amount of time that family members spend on their devices, rather than engaging in meaningful conversations and activities with each other. 

The rise of the nuclear family has also had an impact on the closeness of modern families. With the advent of dual-income households, both parents are often working full-time and have less time to spend with their children. This lack of time together has contributed to a decrease in the closeness of modern families. 

Finally, the growing prevalence of individualism has also had an impact on the closeness of modern families. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on individual achievements, rather than collective accomplishments. This has led to a decrease in the amount of time that family members spend together, as individuals are more focused on their own pursuits. 

In order to combat the decline in the closeness of modern families, there are a number of measures that can be taken. Firstly, families should make an effort to set aside time to spend together. This could include regular family dinners, weekend outings, or simply carving out time for meaningful conversations. Secondly, families should strive to limit the amount of time that they spend on their devices, and instead focus on fostering meaningful relationships with each other. Finally, families should strive to celebrate collective accomplishments, rather than individual achievements. This could include celebrating holidays or birthdays together, or simply taking the time to recognize the accomplishments of each family member. 

In conclusion, it is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increased prevalence of technology, the rise of the nuclear family, and the growing prevalence of individualism. However, by making an effort to set aside time to spend together, limiting the amount of time spent on devices, and celebrating collective accomplishments, families can strive to become closer and more connected.

The idea of fatherhood being equally emphasised as motherhood is a concept that has been gaining traction in recent times, with many people agreeing that this is indeed the case. However, there are still some who disagree with this idea, believing that it is the mother who is solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies, and therefore also responsible for bringing the children up. 

I firmly believe that both parents should be equally involved in the decision-making process when it comes to having children, and that both should be equally responsible for raising them. As a society, we should be encouraging fathers to take a more active role in their children’s lives, both in the home and outside of it. Fathers can provide a unique perspective on life and help shape their children’s values and beliefs. They can also provide emotional support and guidance, which is equally as important as the physical and financial support that mothers can provide. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that children who grow up in a household with both parents actively involved in their lives tend to have better outcomes in terms of emotional and social development. Studies have shown that children who have a strong relationship with both parents have higher self-esteem, better communication skills, and better problem-solving abilities. This is why it is so important for fathers to be actively involved in their children’s lives. 

In conclusion, I believe that fatherhood should be equally emphasised as motherhood, and that both parents should be equally involved in the decision-making process when it comes to having children, as well as in the raising of them. This is important for the emotional and social development of children, and can have a positive impact on their lives.

Language is an important part of culture and identity. It is often said that “a language is a dialect with an army and a navy”. In this context, having a single international official language has been a topic of debate for many years. On the one hand, some people argue that having a single language would make communication easier and improve international understanding. On the other hand, some people argue that having a single language would cause a loss of culture and make it difficult to identify countries. 

In my opinion, having a single international official language would be beneficial in many ways. Firstly, it would make communication easier and help people from different countries to understand each other. This would lead to improved international understanding and cooperation. Secondly, it would help to reduce the language barrier between countries, which would make it easier for people to travel, do business, and interact with people from different countries. 

However, I do not believe that having a single language would cause a loss of culture. In fact, it would give people the opportunity to learn and understand different cultures. For example, people from different countries could learn about each other’s cultures and traditions by learning the same language. This would help to promote cultural exchange and understanding. Furthermore, a single language would not make it difficult to identify countries as countries would still have their own languages and cultures. 

In conclusion, I believe that having a single international official language would be beneficial in many ways. It would make communication easier and help to reduce the language barrier between countries. Furthermore, it would not cause a loss of culture, but rather give people the opportunity to learn and understand different cultures.

India is a country with a rich cultural heritage, with each region having its own unique customs and traditions. One custom that I would like people from other countries to adopt is the practice of celebrating festivals. Festivals are a way of bringing people together and celebrating life in all its diversity.

Festivals in India are celebrated with great enthusiasm and joy. They are an opportunity for people to come together, irrespective of their religious, cultural or social backgrounds. It is an occasion for families to come together and share in the joy of the festivities. People decorate their homes, wear traditional clothes, exchange gifts and prepare delicious food.

The most important aspect of celebrating festivals in India is the spirit of giving. People are generous in sharing their resources with others. This is especially true during festivals such as Diwali, when people exchange gifts with their loved ones. This practice of giving is an important part of Indian culture and it promotes the spirit of togetherness and unity.

Another important aspect of festivals in India is the music and dance. People come together to sing and dance to traditional songs and music. This is a great way to bring people together and to celebrate the spirit of the festival. It is also an opportunity for people to showcase their talent and creativity.

I believe that celebrating festivals is a great way to bring people together and to promote the spirit of togetherness and unity. It is an opportunity for people to come together, irrespective of their backgrounds, and to share in the joy of the festivities. I would like people from other countries to adopt this custom and experience the beauty of our festivals.

Moving to a new country is a life-altering experience and can be both exciting and daunting. It is natural for people to feel a sense of belonging and to want to fit in with the new culture. However, it is also important to maintain one’s own identity and customs. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of both following the customs of the new country and keeping one’s own customs.

On one hand, it is important to respect and follow the customs of the new country. This will help one to integrate into society, make friends, and find employment. It also allows one to experience the new culture and to learn about different customs and traditions. Moreover, it is a sign of respect to the new country and its people.

On the other hand, one should also keep their own customs and traditions alive. This allows one to maintain a sense of identity and belonging to their own culture. It also helps in preserving their culture and passing down the customs and traditions to future generations. Furthermore, it is a way to celebrate one’s own culture and to share it with others.

In my opinion, it is important to find a balance between the two. It is important to respect and follow the customs of the new country, while at the same time, keeping one’s own customs and traditions alive. This way, one can experience the best of both worlds. One can learn about and appreciate the new culture, while also celebrating their own culture and identity. This will help one to feel more connected to both the new country and their home country.

Nowadays, technology has made the world a much smaller place. The Internet, satellite television, and social media have all contributed to a globalized society where people from all over the world can communicate and share ideas. This has led some to believe that modern technology is creating a single world culture. However, I disagree with this statement.

To begin with, technology has made it easier to access information from different cultures, but it hasn’t necessarily made it easier to understand or appreciate those cultures. For example, satellite television may allow people to watch foreign films and television shows, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that those viewers will understand or appreciate the cultural nuances of those stories. Similarly, social media may allow us to connect with people from different backgrounds, but it doesn’t guarantee that we will be able to understand their perspectives and values.

Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to access different cultures, but it hasn’t necessarily made it easier for people to adopt those cultures. For example, technology may allow people to access foreign music, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that those people will adopt the music as part of their own culture. Similarly, technology may allow people to access foreign cuisines, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that those people will adopt those cuisines as part of their own culture.

In conclusion, while technology has made it easier to access different cultures, it hasn’t necessarily made it easier to understand or appreciate those cultures. Furthermore, while technology may allow people to access different cultures, it hasn’t necessarily made it easier for people to adopt those cultures. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that modern technology is creating a single world culture.

Smoking in public places has been a controversial issue for many years. On one hand, some people believe that smoking should be allowed in certain places, while on the other hand, some people argue that smoking should be banned in all public places. In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be banned in all public places. 

Firstly, smoking has a detrimental effect on the health of those who inhale the smoke. Second-hand smoke from cigarettes contains more than 4,000 chemicals, many of which are known to cause cancer. Therefore, it is not fair to expose non-smokers to the dangers of second-hand smoke. In addition, it is also harmful to the environment, as it contributes to air pollution. 

Secondly, smoking in public places can be a nuisance to others. For example, it can be unpleasant to be in a crowded area where people are smoking, and it can also be difficult to avoid the smell of cigarette smoke. This can be particularly troublesome for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. 

Finally, smoking in public places can lead to a decrease in public safety. Cigarette butts are a fire hazard and can cause fires if they are not disposed of properly. In addition, smoking can also be a distraction for drivers, which can lead to accidents. 

In conclusion, I believe that smoking should be banned in all public places. Not only does it pose a health risk to non-smokers, but it can also be a nuisance and a safety hazard. Therefore, I believe that it is in the best interests of both smokers and non-smokers to ban smoking in all public places.

In recent decades, the health risks associated with smoking tobacco have become increasingly clear. As a result, governments around the world have put in place laws that limit the sale and consumption of tobacco products. This has led to a debate as to whether the same laws should be applied to other substances, such as heroin.

On the one hand, it can be argued that the same laws should be applied to both heroin and tobacco. Both substances are known to have serious health risks, and so it could be argued that they should both be treated in the same way. Furthermore, it could be argued that the sale and consumption of both substances should be prohibited in order to protect public health.

On the other hand, it can also be argued that the laws should not be applied in the same way to both substances. Heroin is a highly addictive substance, and so it is necessary to have strict laws in place to prevent its sale and consumption. In contrast, tobacco is not as addictive, and so it could be argued that it should not be subject to the same laws as heroin. Furthermore, it could be argued that the sale and consumption of tobacco should be restricted, rather than completely prohibited.

In conclusion, while it can be argued that the same laws should be applied to both heroin and tobacco, it can also be argued that the laws should be different for each substance. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on the health risks associated with each substance and the potential for addiction.

Drug use is a major problem in modern society, with many young people experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs. While the causes of this problem are complex, sociologists often point to the example set by parents and other members of society as a major contributing factor. This essay will discuss the causes of widespread drug use by young people in modern society, as well as some of its effects, and will provide some recommendations to help fight youth drug abuse.

One of the primary causes of drug use among young people is the example set by their parents and other adults. If parents are engaging in drug use, their children are more likely to do the same. Similarly, if children see adults engaging in drug use in their community, they may feel that it is acceptable to do the same. Additionally, young people may be exposed to drugs in the media, which can normalize drug use and make it seem more appealing.

The effects of widespread drug use among young people can be far-reaching and devastating. Drug use can lead to physical and mental health problems, as well as impaired judgement and decision-making. It can also lead to addiction, which can have serious long-term consequences. Additionally, drug use can lead to criminal behavior, as young people may become involved in the drug trade in order to finance their habit.

In order to help fight youth drug abuse, it is important that parents and other members of society set a good example. Parents should be aware of their children’s activities, and should discuss the dangers of drug use with them. Additionally, schools should provide drug education programs to help young people understand the risks associated with drug use. Finally, it is important that society as a whole take a stand against drug use and make it clear that it is not acceptable.

In conclusion, drug use is a major problem in modern society, and it is often caused by the example set by adults. This problem can have serious consequences, both for individual users and for society as a whole. In order to help fight youth drug abuse, it is important that parents and other members of society set a good example, and that schools provide drug education programs.

Drug abuse has become a major concern in our society today, with its negative effects on individuals, families, and communities. From physical and psychological health issues to financial and legal problems, drug abuse can have a devastating impact. It is important to understand the causes of drug abuse in order to develop effective solutions.

One of the primary causes of drug abuse is the availability of drugs. The ease with which drugs can be obtained can lead to experimentation and eventually, addiction. Drugs are available in various forms, such as prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and illicit substances. In addition, the internet has made it easier to obtain drugs, as they can be purchased online without a prescription.

Another cause of drug abuse is peer pressure. Young people are particularly vulnerable to peer pressure, as they often want to fit in and be accepted by their peers. This can lead them to experiment with drugs, even if they are not interested in using them.

Finally, mental health issues can also contribute to drug abuse. People with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues may turn to drugs as a way to cope with their feelings. This can lead to an addiction, as drugs can provide a temporary escape from reality.

In order to address the problem of drug abuse, a number of solutions can be implemented. First, education about the dangers of drug use should be provided to young people. This can help them to understand the risks associated with drug use and make informed decisions about whether or not to use drugs.

Second, drug treatment programs should be made available to those who are struggling with addiction. These programs can provide the necessary support and resources to help individuals overcome their addiction and lead healthier lives.

Finally, stricter laws and regulations regarding the sale and distribution of drugs should be implemented. This can help to reduce the availability of drugs, which can help to reduce the number of people who use them.

In conclusion, drug abuse is a major problem in our society today, with serious consequences for individuals, families, and communities. By understanding the causes of drug abuse and implementing effective solutions, we can help to reduce the prevalence of drug use and its associated problems.

Smoking has been a contentious issue for many years now, with some people advocating for a complete ban while others argue that it is a personal choice and should be allowed. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument, before concluding that a ban on smoking should be implemented.

On the one hand, it is argued that smoking is a personal choice and should not be regulated. This argument is based on the fact that individuals should be allowed to make their own decisions and should not be restricted by the government. Moreover, it is argued that banning smoking would be an infringement on civil liberties and would be difficult to enforce.

On the other hand, there are compelling arguments for banning smoking. Firstly, smoking has numerous health risks and can lead to serious health problems such as cancer, heart disease and respiratory illnesses. Secondly, smoking has been proven to be a major contributor to air pollution and can have a damaging effect on the environment. Finally, second-hand smoke is a serious health hazard for non-smokers, especially in enclosed spaces such as offices and restaurants.

In conclusion, it is clear that smoking should be banned. The health risks associated with smoking are too great to ignore and the potential damage to the environment is too severe to be ignored. Furthermore, it is unfair to subject non-smokers to second-hand smoke, which can have serious health consequences. Therefore, a ban on smoking should be implemented in order to protect the health of individuals and the environment.

Smoking is a habit that many people around the world indulge in, despite being aware of the health risks associated with it. It is a personal choice that comes with consequences, and one of them is the cost of medical treatment. Smokers should expect to pay more for medical treatment than nonsmokers, as they are more likely to suffer from serious health issues.

Smoking is known to cause a number of health issues, from heart disease and cancer to respiratory problems and stroke. The effects of smoking are well-known, and yet people still choose to smoke. The choice to smoke is a voluntary one, and smokers are aware of the dangers associated with it. It is only fair, then, that they should be held responsible for their actions and be expected to pay more for medical treatment than nonsmokers.

Smokers should be prepared to pay more for medical treatment, as they are more likely to require it. Research has shown that smokers are more likely to suffer from serious health problems than nonsmokers. This means that they are likely to need more medical care than nonsmokers, and they should expect to pay more for it. It is also important to note that smoking-related illnesses can be expensive to treat, and smokers should be prepared to bear the cost.

In conclusion, smokers should expect to pay more for medical treatment than nonsmokers. This is because they are more likely to suffer from serious health problems due to their smoking habit. Smokers should be aware of this and be prepared to bear the cost of medical treatment. It is only fair that they should be held responsible for their actions and be expected to pay more for medical care.

Immunization is an important part of a healthy life. Vaccines help in curbing spread of infectious diseases among children. Due to the advancement in medical science, parents now have the responsibility of making sure that their kids are adequately vaccinated against deadly diseases. Immunization not only prevents children from developing a particular disease, but it also helps in reducing the overall burden of serious diseases by creating herd immunity among people. 

Given the importance of immunization, should parents be obliged to get their children immunized? This is a highly debatable topic and there are two sides to it. On the one hand, parents should be responsible and be obliged to immunize their children in order to protect them from getting infected with dangerous diseases. Vaccination is a right of the child and if parents fail to provide this right, they are responsible for putting their child’s life at risk. Moreover, if the child is unvaccinated and is spreading the disease, it can also affect other children in the community.

On the other hand, individuals have the right to choose whether or not to immunize their children. Some parents may have religious believes or certain other beliefs which may stand in their way of immunizing their children. It is their choice as to what kind of decision to take for their children and the government should not interfere with those decisions. If government forces the parents to vaccinate their children against their will, it can lead to great distress and unrest among people. 

Considering both sides of the argument, it is important to note that an obligation of immunizing child is essential. But, this obligation must be accompanied with proper education and information so that people can make an informed decision. The government should ensure that proper health care facilities and services are available to the people and vaccination should be made affordable and accessible. Moreover, it should be ensured that people are properly educated and aware of the importance of immunization and its consequences. 

In conclusion, while parents should be obliged to immunize their children in order to ensure safety, they should also be provided with sufficient information and support so that they can make an informed decision. It is only after giving proper thought to both sides of the argument, that one can come to a firm conclusion on this issue.

Immunisation is an important part of modern healthcare, providing protection against a wide range of diseases. In the past, many children have suffered and even died from diseases that could have been prevented by immunisation. This has led to the question of whether parents should be obliged to immunise their children against childhood diseases or whether individuals have the right to choose not to immunise their children. 

On one hand, there are those who argue that parents should be obliged to immunise their children against childhood diseases. The main argument in favour of this is that immunisation is the best way to protect children from serious illnesses, and that by not immunising, parents are putting their children at risk of contracting serious and potentially fatal diseases. In addition, there is a public health argument in favour of immunisation, as it helps to protect the wider community by reducing the spread of disease.

On the other hand, there are those who argue that individuals have the right to choose not to immunise their children. This argument is based on the idea that individuals should have the freedom to make decisions about their own health, and that it is not the place of the government to dictate what people should or should not do. In addition, some argue that there is a lack of scientific evidence to support the efficacy of immunisation, and that there are potential risks associated with immunisation which parents should have the right to choose not to take. 

In conclusion, while there are arguments both for and against immunisation, it is clear that the decision of whether or not to immunise should be left to the individual. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of parents to make informed decisions about their children's health and to weigh up the risks and benefits of immunisation before making a decision.

The old adage ‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true even in the modern age. It is a simple concept that emphasizes on avoiding the occurrence of a problem rather than attempting to fix it after it has occurred. This is especially true in regards to health, as prevention helps to protect us from developing diseases and illnesses, thereby saving us from the pain and cost of treatment.

One of the best forms of prevention is lifestyle modification. Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and avoiding harmful substances like alcohol and nicotine can go a long way in protecting us from developing serious illnesses. Furthermore, it is important to get regular check-ups and screenings to detect any potential health issues in their early stages. Doing so can help to prevent the progression of the disease and can even save lives.

Apart from health, prevention is also important in other aspects of life. For instance, it is important to take precautions to prevent accidents and other mishaps. Wearing a seatbelt while driving, following traffic rules, wearing protective gear while playing sports, and being aware of our surroundings can help to protect us from harm. Similarly, it is important to take the necessary steps to prevent environmental damage, such as reducing our energy consumption, using renewable sources of energy, and reducing our waste.

In conclusion, prevention is indeed better than cure. Taking the necessary steps to protect our health, safety, and environment can help to save us from a lot of trouble and cost in the long run. Therefore, it is important to focus on prevention and take the necessary measures to ensure our well-being.

The debate on whether studying the English language in an English-speaking country is the best way to learn it has been raging for years. While some people believe it is the most effective way to learn the language, others argue that there are other equally effective ways of learning it. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that studying the English language in an English-speaking country is the best but not the only way to learn it. 

Firstly, studying the English language in an English-speaking country is the best way to learn it because it immerses the learner in the language. Being in an English-speaking country exposes the learner to the language in a natural and everyday way. This provides an opportunity to learn the language in a more authentic and meaningful way than any other method. For example, the learner can hear the language being spoken in various contexts and learn the nuances of the language. 

Secondly, studying the English language in an English-speaking country also provides the learner with a chance to interact with native speakers. This helps the learner get accustomed to the language and understand the native accent. Additionally, the learner can pick up new words and phrases from the native speakers and learn to use them in everyday conversations. 

Thirdly, studying the English language in an English-speaking country also gives the learner an opportunity to experience the culture of the country. This helps the learner understand the language in a better way as the language is closely linked to the culture. The learner can also learn about the customs and traditions of the country and gain a deeper understanding of the language. 

However, studying the English language in an English-speaking country is not the only way to learn it. There are other equally effective ways of learning the language. For example, online courses and language exchange programs are effective alternatives to learning the language. Online courses provide the learner with an opportunity to learn the language from the comfort of their own home. Additionally, language exchange programs provide the learner with a chance to interact with native speakers and learn the language in a more interactive way. 

In conclusion, I believe that studying the English language in an English-speaking country is the best but not the only way to learn it. It provides the learner with an opportunity to immerse themselves in the language, interact with native speakers and experience the culture of the country. However, there are other equally effective ways of learning the language such as online courses and language exchange programs.

The world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and the ability to communicate with people from different cultures is an invaluable asset. Learning a foreign language provides a unique insight into how people from other cultures think and see the world, and can be incredibly beneficial for both personal and professional development. For this reason, many people believe that the teaching of a foreign language should be compulsory at all primary schools. While there are some advantages to this approach, I disagree with the notion that foreign language teaching should be mandatory for all primary school students.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that learning a foreign language can be a difficult and time-consuming process. While some students may find it easy to pick up a new language, others may struggle and become frustrated. Forcing students to learn a foreign language may therefore have a negative impact on their academic performance, as they may become overwhelmed and demotivated.

Furthermore, there are other skills and topics that are of greater importance for primary school students. For example, primary school students should be encouraged to focus on developing their literacy and numeracy skills, as these are the foundation for all other learning. Additionally, primary school students should be given the opportunity to explore and develop their creativity through art, music, and drama. If foreign language teaching becomes compulsory, these activities may be neglected and students may miss out on important learning opportunities.

In conclusion, while I agree that learning a foreign language can be incredibly beneficial, I do not believe that it should be compulsory at primary school level. Primary school students should be given the opportunity to explore and develop a range of skills and interests, which will enable them to become well-rounded individuals.

The debate around the death penalty has been a long and winding one, with opinions divided on the morality of the act. This statement proposes that by punishing murderers with the death penalty, society is also guilty of committing murder, and thus life in prison is a better punishment for murderers. While there are arguments to be made for both sides, I agree with this statement to a large extent. 

The death penalty is an irreversible punishment, and thus by taking away the life of a murderer, society is indeed guilty of committing a murder. This is a valid argument, particularly when it comes to cases of wrongful conviction. It is not unheard of for innocent people to be sentenced to death, and in such cases, the wrongdoers are not only the individuals responsible for the wrongful conviction, but also the society that allowed it to happen. In this sense, life in prison is a much better punishment, as it allows for the possibility of the sentence being overturned if new evidence comes to light. 

On the other hand, some may argue that the death penalty is a necessary deterrent for serious crimes such as murder, and that life in prison does not provide the same level of deterrence. While this is a valid argument, it is worth noting that the death penalty has been abolished in many countries, and yet the crime rate has not seen a significant increase in these countries. This suggests that the death penalty is not necessarily an effective deterrent, and that life in prison can be just as effective in deterring potential criminals. 

In conclusion, while there are arguments to be made for both sides, I agree with the statement that life in prison is a better punishment for murderers than the death penalty. The death penalty is an irreversible punishment, and thus by taking away the life of a murderer, society is indeed guilty of committing a murder. Furthermore, the death penalty does not appear to be an effective deterrent, as evidenced by its abolition in many countries. For these reasons, life in prison is a much better punishment for murderers.

Animals have been used in scientific research for centuries, and the use of animals in testing new drugs and procedures is still a hotly debated topic. On the one hand, some people argue that using animals in this way is cruel and unnecessary, while others believe that it is a necessary part of medical progress. 

It is undeniable that animals can suffer in the process of testing new drugs and procedures. Animals are often subjected to painful and potentially fatal experiments, and this raises serious ethical issues. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the results of animal experiments will be applicable to humans, meaning that the pain and suffering endured by animals may be for nothing. 

However, it is also true that testing new drugs and procedures on animals is sometimes the only way to ensure the safety of humans. For example, if a new drug is to be released to the public, it must first be tested on animals to make sure it is safe for human use. Similarly, if a new medical procedure is to be used on humans, it must first be tested on animals to make sure it is safe and effective. In this way, animal testing can be seen as a necessary evil if we want to make sure that new drugs and procedures are safe for humans.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use animals in testing new drugs and procedures should be based on a careful consideration of the ethical, scientific, and practical implications. On the one hand, the ethical concerns of animal testing must be taken seriously, and any unnecessary suffering should be avoided. On the other hand, animal testing can be a vital part of medical progress, and should not be dismissed out of hand. It is therefore important to find a balance between these two perspectives in order to ensure that animals are treated humanely, while also making sure that new drugs and procedures are safe for human use.

Animals have been used in medical research for centuries, and this practice has been the subject of much debate. On one hand, it is argued that animals should not be used for testing new drugs and procedures because of the ethical considerations involved. On the other hand, proponents argue that animal testing is necessary for the advancement of medical science.

In my opinion, animals should not be used for testing new drugs and procedures. It is morally wrong to use animals for this purpose as they are living, sentient creatures that can suffer pain, stress, and discomfort. Furthermore, animals are not able to give their consent for the research and this raises serious ethical questions.

Moreover, there are alternative methods that can be used for testing new drugs and procedures. For example, scientists can use computer simulations, tissue cultures, and epidemiological studies to obtain reliable data without having to resort to animal testing. These methods are more humane and can provide accurate results that can be used to develop new treatments.

Finally, animal testing is not always reliable. Different species may respond differently to the same drugs, and this could lead to inaccurate conclusions. In addition, animals may not be able to accurately mimic the effects of drugs on humans, thus making the results of the tests unreliable.

In conclusion, animals should not be used for testing new drugs and procedures. Alternative methods should be used instead, as they are more humane and reliable. Furthermore, using animals for testing raises serious ethical questions that should be taken into consideration.

The news of a company's plan to build a large factory near my community has been met with mixed reactions. On one hand, the factory could bring jobs and economic growth to the area, while on the other hand, it could have a negative impact on the environment, as well as the quality of life of the people living in the community. 

The most obvious advantage of the factory is the potential for job creation. With the new factory, more people in the community would be able to find employment, which could help to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for many. The factory could also help to boost the local economy, as more money will be spent in the area, creating more business opportunities. 

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to the factory. The most pressing concern is the environmental impact. The factory could release large amounts of pollution into the air and water, which could have a negative effect on the health of people living in the area. Additionally, noise pollution could be an issue, as the factory could create a lot of noise, making it difficult for people to sleep at night. 

Ultimately, I believe that the potential benefits of the factory outweigh the potential drawbacks. The factory could create jobs and stimulate the local economy, which could have a positive effect on the community as a whole. However, it is important that the company takes steps to minimize the environmental impact of the factory, such as using clean energy sources and implementing strict pollution control measures. 

For these reasons, I support the factory being built near my community. I believe that with the right measures in place, the factory could be a positive influence on the area, bringing economic growth and job opportunities.

In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on my community and explain why I support the building of the factory. 

The first advantage of the factory is that it could bring much-needed jobs to the community. With the factory in place, many people in the area would be able to find employment. This would help to reduce unemployment levels, and would also provide a boost to the local economy.

This could have a negative impact on the environment, as well as on the quality of life of the people living near the factory. Furthermore, the factory could also lead to a decrease in property values, as people may be reluctant to buy homes near a large industrial complex. 

Despite these potential drawbacks, I believe that the advantages of the factory outweigh the disadvantages. The jobs and educational opportunities that the factory could bring would be of great benefit to the local community. Furthermore, the local government could put in place measures to reduce the negative impact of the factory, such as enforcing strict environmental regulations and investing in public transportation. 

In conclusion, I support the building of the factory near my community. The potential benefits of the factory, such as job creation and educational opportunities, outweigh the potential drawbacks.

The debate over whether a city should preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings is a contentious one. On one hand, there are those who view the preservation of old buildings as a way to maintain a city’s unique cultural and historical identity. On the other hand, there are those who argue that replacing old buildings with modern ones is necessary to keep up with the times and to ensure the city remains competitive. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the specific needs and circumstances of the city in question. 

Those who advocate for the preservation of old buildings typically cite the importance of maintaining a city’s unique cultural and historical identity. Old buildings often serve as reminders of the city’s past, and are often a source of pride for the citizens who live there. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings can also help to attract tourists and other visitors who are interested in the city’s history. Additionally, the preservation of old buildings can also help to create a sense of continuity and stability, which can be beneficial in times of rapid change and uncertainty. 

On the other hand, those who argue for the destruction of old buildings and their replacement with modern ones often cite the need to keep up with the times and to ensure the city remains competitive.

Additionally, modern buildings often have a lower environmental impact than older buildings, and can help to reduce the city’s carbon footprint. Furthermore, replacing old buildings with modern ones can also help to create jobs and stimulate the local economy. 

Ultimately, the decision of whether to preserve or replace old buildings should be based on the specific needs and circumstances of the city in question. For example, if a city is struggling economically, then replacing old buildings with modern ones may be a necessary step to help stimulate the local economy. On the other hand, if a city is trying to maintain its unique cultural and historical identity, then preserving old buildings may be the better option.

The modern age has seen a remarkable transformation in the way cities look and feel. In the past, cities used to reflect the culture of a society, with distinct architecture and a unique character. However, today, cities throughout the world are becoming more and more similar as modern buildings are increasingly looking alike.

The primary reason behind this is the globalization of the world. With the emergence of multinational corporations and the development of global markets, the same corporate style has been adopted in most cities, leading to a homogenous look and feel. Moreover, the advancement of technology has made it easier to replicate the same designs across different cities. This has resulted in a standardization of architecture and design, thus making cities look more similar.

The question as to whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is a matter of debate. On the one hand, it could be argued that this homogenization of architecture allows for a greater sense of unity between different cities, and makes it easier for people to identify with different places. On the other hand, it could be argued that this lack of diversity in architecture is a bad thing, as it takes away from the unique character of each city and reduces the potential for creativity and innovation.

In conclusion, it is evident that cities throughout the world are becoming increasingly similar as modern buildings are looking more alike. This is mainly due to globalization and the advancement of technology, and whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is a matter of opinion.

Public buildings are a common sight in major cities around the world. They are often very old, having been built hundreds of years ago, and some are brand new. While public buildings can be a great source of pride for a city and its citizens, they can also be costly and inefficient. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of public buildings and examine the importance of constructing impressive public buildings when housing is really required.

One of the main advantages of public buildings is that they provide a sense of civic pride. Many people take pride in their city and its public buildings, which can be seen as a symbol of the city’s success and importance. Furthermore, public buildings can be used for a variety of purposes, such as government offices, museums, and libraries. This makes them a great resource for the community, as they provide access to services and knowledge that would otherwise be unavailable.

On the other hand, public buildings can be extremely costly to construct and maintain. This is especially true for older buildings, which often require extensive renovation and repair. Furthermore, public buildings can be inefficient, as they often require large staffs and consume a lot of energy. Finally, public buildings can be difficult to access for people with disabilities, as they are often not designed with accessibility in mind.

When it comes to the importance of constructing impressive public buildings when housing is really required, it is important to consider the context. In some cases, it may be more important to prioritize housing over public buildings. For example, in cities with a high rate of homelessness, it may be more important to focus on providing housing for those in need. On the other hand, in cities with a stable housing market, public buildings can be a great source of pride and a way to attract visitors and investment.

In conclusion, public buildings can be a great source of pride for a city and its citizens, but they can also be costly and inefficient. Ultimately, the importance of constructing impressive public buildings when housing is really required depends on the context of the city. In some cases, it may be more important to prioritize housing over public buildings, while in other cases public buildings can be a great source of pride and a way to attract visitors and investment.

The world has become increasingly globalised in the past few decades, and this has had a major impact on the way cities across the globe look. It is true that modern buildings often look the same, with a lack of cultural diversity in their design. This is a worrying trend, as it means that cities are becoming more and more similar, and their unique cultural identity is being lost.

The most obvious example of this trend is the increasing number of skyscrapers in cities worldwide. These buildings are often designed with a focus on practicality and efficiency, rather than on reflecting the culture of the society they are in. This is understandable, as the same design can be used in different cities, meaning that it is simpler and more cost-effective to construct. However, this means that cities are becoming increasingly homogeneous, with the same types of buildings in each one.

The lack of cultural identity in modern buildings is also having a negative effect on the people who live in them. It can lead to a sense of disconnection and alienation, as the buildings fail to reflect the culture of the people who inhabit them. This can be especially true for people who have moved to a new city, as the buildings may not reflect their own culture, making it harder for them to connect with their new home.

Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to address this issue. For example, governments could incentivise architects to design buildings that are unique to the culture of the city they are in. This could be done by providing funding for such projects, or by offering tax breaks to developers who build culturally-sensitive buildings.

In conclusion, it is true that modern buildings often look the same, and this is having a negative impact on cities across the globe. However, there are solutions to this problem, such as providing incentives for architects to design culturally-sensitive buildings. If this is done, then cities will be able to retain their unique cultural identity and the people who live in them will be able to connect with their home.

Change is an inevitable part of life and it can be seen as both a positive and a negative thing. On one hand, some people enjoy change and they look forward to new experiences. They believe that life should be filled with new opportunities and that they should take full advantage of them. They are open to different ideas, cultures, and experiences, and they believe that these will help them grow and develop. On the other hand, some people prefer to keep their lives the same and they do not like to change their usual habits. They are content with their current situation and they don’t feel the need to explore new things. 

I personally prefer the first approach to life. I believe that change brings about growth and new opportunities, and it can be a great learning experience. I also believe that it can help us to become more open-minded and tolerant of different ideas and cultures. Additionally, it can also help us to become more creative and innovative, as we are exposed to different perspectives and ideas. 

At the same time, I understand why some people prefer to stay the same and avoid change. It can be comforting and reassuring to stay in one’s comfort zone, and it can be difficult to take risks and explore new things. However, I believe that the benefits of embracing change outweigh the risks.

Eating out at food stands or restaurants is a popular pastime for many people, while others prefer to prepare and eat food at home. In my opinion, I believe that I prefer to prepare and eat food at home. 

The primary reason for my preference is that I can cook the food to my own taste. I get to decide the ingredients and how much of each ingredient I want to use. This allows me to customize the dish to my own liking. For example, I can make a curry dish with extra vegetables and less spice, which is something that I cannot do when eating out. 

Another reason I prefer to eat at home is that it is often more economical. Eating out can be expensive, especially if I am eating at a restaurant. I can save money by shopping for ingredients and preparing the food myself. This is especially true if I am cooking for multiple people. I can also save money by using leftovers for subsequent meals. 

Finally, I prefer to eat at home because I can control the environment. I can choose to have a quiet dinner with my family, or I can invite friends over for a lively dinner party. I can also listen to my favorite music and watch my favorite shows while I am eating. This is something that I cannot do when I am eating out.

Fashion trends have always been a major part of our lives and have been changing over the years. While some people believe that these trends are created to only sell clothes, others think that they should be followed. In my opinion, I believe that we should not be following fashion trends blindly and that we should dress in what we like and feel comfortable in.

Firstly, fashion trends are often expensive and not everyone can afford them. Furthermore, it is often difficult to find the right size and fit of the clothes from the latest trends. Therefore, it would be more practical and economical to wear clothes that we like and feel comfortable in, instead of trying to get the newest trends.

Secondly, fashion trends often change quickly and it is nearly impossible to keep up with them. Therefore, it is better to wear what we like and feel comfortable in, instead of constantly trying to keep up with the changing trends. This will also save us a lot of time and energy that we can use for other activities.

Finally, if we wear what we like and feel comfortable in, it will help us to express our personality and style. We will be able to stand out from the crowd and be unique. This will also help us to gain more confidence in ourselves and our style.

In conclusion, I believe that we should not be blindly following fashion trends and that we should dress in what we like and feel comfortable in. This will not only save us money and time, but it will also help us to express our personality and style.

Nowadays, the availability of ready-made and easy to prepare food has made life much easier for people. This has changed the way we live and the way we cook our meals. 

The most obvious benefit of easy to prepare food is the convenience it provides. It is much easier to pick up a pre-made meal or cook something with minimal preparation than it is to cook a full meal from scratch. This has allowed people to save time, as they can now easily prepare meals in a fraction of the time it used to take to cook a full meal. This extra time can be used to pursue other interests or just relax. 

Another benefit is the variety of food that is now available. Ready-made meals and easy to prepare ingredients have allowed people to access a much wider range of food than before. This has allowed people to experiment and explore different types of cuisine, which can be a great way to broaden their culinary horizons. 

Additionally, these food options are often much healthier than the traditional home-cooked meals. Ready-made meals are generally lower in fat and calories than home-cooked meals, and they also usually contain fewer preservatives and additives. This has allowed people to eat healthier without having to spend extra time and effort in the kitchen. 

However, there are some drawbacks to this change in the way we prepare food. One is that it may lead to a lack of cooking skills, as people are no longer required to cook from scratch. This could lead to a lack of understanding of basic nutrition and the importance of a balanced diet. Additionally, ready-made meals tend to be more expensive than home-cooked meals, which can be a burden for those on a budget. 

Overall, the availability of easy to prepare food has changed the way we live and has allowed us to save time and money. It has also given us access to a wider variety of food, which can be a great way to explore different types of cuisine. However, it is important to remember the importance of basic cooking skills and nutrition and to be aware of the potential drawbacks of relying too heavily on ready-made meals.

Change is an inevitable process of life and it occurs in a variety of ways - from subtle shifts to dramatic turns. Depending on personal view, some people may favour to stay in routine and keep their lives steady-state, while others may embrace the recurring transformation that life brings. 

For those people welcoming a continuous change, the ability to expand their self-awareness and grow beyond their self-imposed boxes is what encourage them to embark on the journey of self-discovery. As such it affords them the opportunity to experiment with different activities in order to build desired skills, pursue new career paths and insight into physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the world we live in. Consequently, these people can often feel more invigorated and satisfied with the versatility of life.

On the other hand, there are those people who choose a life of durability and stay away from uncertainty and insecurity brought by unpredictability of life changes. These people experience a sense of stability with moments of joy as they already familiarize with events, places and persons. By keeping away from discomfort of change they can steadily explore their inner strengths and weaknesses, as well as identify trajectories of life that bring them the most satisfaction.

In my opinion, I believe that for one to satisfy the needs of their lives it is essential to recognize the balance between the change and routine. Although in the fast-paced world of today the importance of change is demonstrated, stability and consistency is still of great importance in order to establish a sense of continuity in life. Therefore, it is only with a steady frame of mind that we may aspire to reach our goals, while altering our perceptions further along with the changes.

Sports have always been a great way of bringing people together. Whether it is a local game played between two teams or an international tournament, sports have the ability to bring people from different backgrounds and cultures together.

Dangerous sports can be defined as activities that leave participants vulnerable to physical injury or death and therefore, bear inherent risks of extreme harm. Such activities include rodeos, mountaineering, and skydiving, to name a few. There has been a long-running debate on whether these sports should be banned or not. In my opinion, it would be unjustified and unfair to impose a ban on dangerous sports.

Firstly, without any doubt, an individual intending to participate in a dangerous sport should be well aware of the risks and the potential harm associated with it. So, it is the responsibility of the participant to think responsibly and make an informed decision to participate or not. A ban on dangerous sports would be curtailing this personal choice, and thus, threatening the basic fundamental right of freedom of choice. 

The second argument in favor of not banning dangerous sports is that such activities promote a culture of resilience and create an opportunity to develop creative ways of problem-solving. Skydiving, for example, can teach participants to be alert and mindful of their physical environment; and to identify potential problems and develop solutions to overcome them.

Thirdly, the dangers posed by certain sports, while real, do not constitute a public danger. Therefore, a blanket ban on the said activities would be unnecessary. The onus to protect participants lies on the organisers and practitioners of such activities by following all relevant safety guidelines, and no amount of regulation can substitute individual responsibility and precaution.

In conclusion, imposing a complete ban on dangerous sports would be counterproductive as participants should be free to decide for themselves whether or not to participate in such activities. Such activitiesform a necessary part of the overall culture and, when performed in a regulated manner, can even help participants develop useful skills.

Sports have been an integral part of our lives since time immemorial. It is not only a source of entertainment, but also an important activity that has immense physical, mental and social benefits. Unfortunately, due to the rapid urbanization and industrialization, sports have been neglected and are slowly disappearing from our lives.

It is time to act and save our sports. Governments, organizations and individuals should come together to promote sports and make it an integral part of our lives. Governments should make sports a priority in their budget and allocate funds to promote sports. They should also introduce policies that encourage people to take part in sports activities. Organizations should also come forward and sponsor sports events and provide financial assistance to athletes.

Individuals also have a major role to play in saving sports. They should make an effort to participate in sports activities and encourage their children to do the same. Parents should also ensure that their children have access to sports facilities and equipment. They should also encourage their children to take up sports as a career.

In addition to this, sports should be made a part of the school curriculum. Schools should have adequate sports facilities and provide adequate time for students to participate in sports activities. This will help to inculcate the importance of sports in the minds of the students.

To conclude, sports are an important part of our lives and we must take measures to save them.

Another major change in the 21st century has been the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has enabled us to automate complex tasks and make decisions more quickly and accurately. For example, AI can be used to diagnose diseases, analyze data, and even drive cars. This has allowed us to make decisions faster and more accurately, and has made our lives easier and more efficient.

The 21st century has also seen a rise in automation and robotics. Automation and robotics have made it possible to automate mundane tasks, freeing up our time for more creative and productive pursuits. This has led to a shift in the way we work, with many jobs being replaced by robots and machines.

Finally, the 21st century has seen a rise in the use of renewable energy sources. This has allowed us to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce our carbon footprint. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy are becoming more widely available and are becoming increasingly cost-effective.

In conclusion, the 21st century has brought with it a myriad of changes and advancements. From the rise of technology to the rise of automation and robotics, the 21st century has seen tremendous changes in our lives. These changes have made our lives easier, more efficient, and more sustainable.

Space exploration has been a part of humanity for centuries and has been a source of inspiration for many generations. In 1969, the first manned mission to the moon was a historic event that marked a major milestone in our understanding of the universe. However, in the last three decades, some people have argued that space research is a waste of money. This essay will discuss both points of view and conclude with a personal opinion.

On the one hand, some people believe that space exploration is a waste of money because of the high cost involved. They argue that the money spent on space research could be better used to solve problems here on Earth, such as poverty and hunger. This is a valid point of view, as there are many pressing issues on our planet that require urgent attention and resources.

On the other hand, there are many benefits to space exploration. For example, it has led to the development of new technologies such as space-based communication systems, which are used for applications such as navigation and weather forecasting. In addition, space exploration has allowed us to gain a better understanding of our universe and the potential for life on other planets. This knowledge can help us to make informed decisions about the future of our planet.

In my opinion, space exploration is a worthwhile investment in the future of humanity. Although it is true that the cost of space exploration is high, the benefits to humanity far outweigh the cost. It is important to remember that space exploration is not only about science and technology, but also about exploration and discovery. It is an investment in our future, and one that should be supported by governments and individuals alike.

Traveling has always been an integral part of our lives. It not only helps us to explore different places, cultures and customs, but also helps us to break away from the monotony of our daily lives and rejuvenate ourselves. In recent times, the nature of the average holiday has seen a substantial shift. According to those in the travel business, people are now seeking more exiting and challenging activities, rather than a relaxing break in a far-away place.

I agree with this notion to a certain extent. It is true that people nowadays want to experience something new and exciting on their holidays, rather than just lying on a beach or going sightseeing. This is mainly because of the availability of a plethora of activities that can be undertaken during a holiday. From adventure sports like bungee jumping, paragliding, skiing and river rafting, to cultural activities like exploring local cuisines and attending music festivals, there are a variety of activities that can be enjoyed by tourists. This helps them to break away from the mundane routine of their lives and allows them to experience something new and exciting.

However, I also believe that relaxation should be an important part of any holiday. While it is true that people now want to experience something new and exciting on their holidays, it is also important to take some time out and relax. This helps to rejuvenate the mind and body and get away from the stress of daily life. Therefore, I believe that a balance should be maintained between activities and relaxation on a holiday.

To conclude, I believe that the nature of the average holiday is changing, with people now seeking more exiting and challenging activities. However, it is important to remember that relaxation should also be an important part of any holiday.

I am looking forward to visiting some of the country’s most famous sites, such as Mount Fuji and the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. I am also excited to explore some of the lesser-known attractions, such as the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo and the Akiyoshidai Nature Park in Yamaguchi. 

In conclusion, Japan is the perfect destination for a two-week vacation. With its unique culture, friendly people, and wide range of attractions, I am sure I will have an unforgettable experience in this beautiful country.

International tourism has become one of the biggest industries in the world, with people travelling to different countries to experience their culture, cuisine and attractions. However, it is true that international tourism can create tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures. 

In some cases, tourists may not be aware of the local customs and culture, and this can lead to misunderstandings. For example, tourists may dress inappropriately or not show respect to local religious sites. This can create tension between tourists and locals, which can lead to further cultural divides. 

Furthermore, international tourism can also lead to economic tension. Tourists may not be aware of the local prices and may be charged more than locals. This can create a sense of unfairness and resentment, which can lead to further tension between tourists and locals. 

On the other hand, international tourism can also bring people from different cultures together. Tourists may be exposed to different cultures and customs, which can lead to greater understanding and appreciation. For example, tourists may learn about local cuisine, customs and traditions, which can create a sense of mutual respect and understanding. 

In conclusion, while it is true that international tourism can create tension between people from different cultures, it can also lead to greater understanding and appreciation. It is therefore important for tourists to be aware of local customs and etiquette, and to show respect to locals, in order to create a positive experience for all involved.

The debate between working for a large or a small company is one that has been going on for some time. While both have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for a small company. 

The main advantage of working for a small company is that employees have a greater sense of ownership. As there are fewer people, the employees are able to take on more responsibility and have a greater say in the company’s direction. This can be extremely rewarding and motivating for employees, as they can see the direct impact of their work. Furthermore, this can lead to greater job satisfaction and a stronger sense of loyalty to the company, which can help to reduce employee turnover. 

In addition, working for a small company often means that the working environment is more relaxed and informal. This can help to foster a greater sense of camaraderie amongst employees and make the workplace a more enjoyable place to be. In comparison, large companies often have a more hierarchical structure, which can make it more difficult for employees to build relationships with their colleagues. 

However, working for a large company does have its advantages. One of the main benefits is that the company is more likely to have access to a greater range of resources. This can make it easier for employees to do their job, as they have access to the latest technology and other resources. Furthermore, large companies often have better career prospects, as there are more opportunities for employees to progress within the company. 

In conclusion, I would prefer to work for a small company. This is because I feel that I would have a greater sense of ownership and be able to build stronger relationships with my colleagues. Furthermore, I would be able to take on more responsibility and have a greater say in the company’s direction.

Working in a job with colleagues is a necessity in today’s world. A good working relationship with one’s co-workers is essential to ensure a productive and successful work environment. In my opinion, there are several important characteristics that a co-worker should possess to make the work experience a pleasant one. 

Firstly, a good co-worker should possess a sense of trustworthiness and reliability. This is important as it allows for a sense of security and comfort when working together. A good co-worker should also be able to be trusted to complete tasks on time and in an efficient manner. This ensures that the work is done properly and in a timely manner. Furthermore, a co-worker should be honest and transparent in their dealings with others. This allows for an open and healthy working relationship. 

Another important characteristic of a co-worker is flexibility. This means that they should be able to adapt to different situations and be willing to take on tasks that may be outside of their usual scope of work. This is important as it allows for a more efficient work environment as tasks can be delegated to those who are best suited for them. Furthermore, a good co-worker should be able to work with others in a collaborative manner. This involves being able to listen to ideas and opinions of others and being willing to compromise when needed. 

Lastly, a co-worker should possess a good attitude. This means that they should be positive and enthusiastic about their work and the tasks they are assigned. This allows for a more productive and enjoyable work experience. Furthermore, a good co-worker should be able to provide constructive criticism when needed. This allows for a more efficient work environment as tasks can be improved and mistakes can be avoided. 

In conclusion, I believe that the characteristics of trustworthiness, reliability, flexibility, collaboration and a positive attitude are important for a good co-worker. These characteristics allow for a more efficient and enjoyable work experience and ensure that tasks are completed in a timely and efficient manner.

A good supervisor (boss) is an essential part of any successful organisation. As the leader of a team, they must be able to motivate, inspire, and encourage their staff to reach their goals. A good supervisor is someone who has a strong work ethic and is able to lead by example. They must also possess certain qualities that will ensure their team works effectively and efficiently.

The first quality of a good supervisor is that they must be an effective communicator. They must be able to clearly explain tasks and objectives to their team in order to ensure their staff are able to complete their work in a timely manner. They should also be able to effectively listen to their team's concerns and provide solutions. A supervisor should be able to provide constructive feedback to their staff and be able to work through any issues that may arise.

Another important quality of a good supervisor is that they must be able to delegate tasks. A supervisor should be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their team and assign tasks accordingly. This will ensure that tasks are completed in an efficient manner and that everyone is working to their full potential.

A good supervisor should also be able to motivate their team. They should be able to recognise the hard work and dedication of their staff and reward them accordingly. This will help to boost morale and ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal.

Finally, a good supervisor should be able to provide support and guidance to their team. They should be able to provide their team with the resources and tools they need to be successful. They should also be able to provide their team with the necessary training and development opportunities.

It is a widely accepted notion that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. However, I disagree with this idea. In my opinion, businesses should not hire employees for their entire lives for several reasons.

First and foremost, hiring employees for their entire lives means that businesses would be unable to take advantage of the latest technologies and trends. Over time, technology and trends change and businesses need to be able to keep up with those changes in order to remain competitive. By hiring employees for their entire lives, businesses would be unable to bring in new talent with the latest skills and knowledge to help them stay ahead of the competition.

Second, hiring employees for their entire lives would mean that businesses would be unable to benefit from the fresh perspectives and ideas that new employees bring. New employees often bring with them new ideas and ways of thinking that can be beneficial to a business. By hiring employees for their entire lives, businesses would be unable to benefit from this influx of new ideas and perspectives.

Finally, hiring employees for their entire lives would mean that businesses would be unable to benefit from the cost savings associated with hiring new employees. New employees often come with lower salaries and benefits than existing employees, which can help businesses save money in the long run. By hiring employees for their entire lives, businesses would be unable to take advantage of these cost savings.

In conclusion, I believe that businesses should not hire employees for their entire lives. Doing so would prevent businesses from taking advantage of the latest technologies and trends, the fresh perspectives and ideas that new employees bring, and the cost savings associated with hiring new employees.

When it comes to trying new things and taking risks, I prefer to take the plunge. I believe that it is important to challenge oneself and to be open to new experiences. This is because pushing the boundaries of one's comfort zone can lead to personal growth, increased knowledge, and satisfaction. 

For example, when I was in college, I decided to take a course that was outside of my major. It was a course in computer programming, something I had never done before. I was really scared at first because I was not sure if I would be able to understand the material. But I decided to take a chance and ended up learning a lot. Not only did I gain knowledge in the subject, but I also learned how to approach new challenges with confidence. 

Moreover, trying new things and taking risks can also lead to new opportunities. For example, a few years ago, I decided to take a chance and apply for a job that was outside of my field. I was nervous about the interview process, but I ended up getting the job. This job opened up a lot of new doors for me and allowed me to explore different career paths.

Finally, taking risks and trying new things can also lead to personal satisfaction. I have found that when I take the time to challenge myself and try something new, I feel a sense of accomplishment. It is a great feeling to know that I am capable of doing something that I thought was impossible.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to take risks and try new things. Doing so can lead to personal growth, increased knowledge, new opportunities, and satisfaction. Therefore, I prefer to take the plunge and challenge myself.

The idea that companies should encourage their employees who work in high positions to leave at the age of 55 has been a topic of much debate. On one hand, it is argued that this would give opportunities to the new generation and allow them to progress in their careers. On the other hand, it is argued that this would lead to a loss of valuable experience and knowledge. In my opinion, I believe that companies should be encouraged to create a balance between the two, rather than forcing employees to leave at a certain age.

Firstly, it is essential to note that there is a lot of value in having experienced employees in the workplace, particularly in high positions. These employees have a deep understanding of the workplace, the industry and the company itself. This is something that cannot be replaced by younger generations, regardless of how much potential they may have. Therefore, it is important to recognize the importance of these experienced employees and allow them to stay in their positions for as long as they are able.

Secondly, as much as it is important to recognize the value of experienced employees, it is also essential to provide opportunities to the new generation. This is why I believe that companies should look to create a balance between the two, rather than forcing employees to leave at a certain age. For example, companies could introduce a policy which allows experienced employees to stay in their positions for a certain period of time, while also encouraging them to mentor the younger generation and pass on their knowledge and experience. This would allow the new generation to benefit from the experience of the older generation, while also allowing them to progress in their careers.

In conclusion, while I agree that companies should look to provide opportunities to the new generation, I do not believe that this should be done at the expense of experienced employees. Instead, companies should look to create a balance between the two, by allowing experienced employees to stay in their positions for a certain period of time, while also encouraging them to mentor the younger generation. This would allow the new generation to benefit from the experience of the older generation, while also allowing them to progress in their careers.

Retirement age is a controversial topic with varying opinions on when is the right time for people to be encouraged to remain in paid employment. In some countries, the average worker is obliged to retire at the age of 50, while in others people can work until they are 65 or 70. This discrepancy creates confusion about what is the most appropriate age for people to retire.

In my opinion, people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment until the age of 65. This age is considered to be the age when people are physically and mentally fit to continue working. It is also the age when they can still contribute to society with their knowledge and experience. Furthermore, working until 65 can help people maintain their financial security and independence, which is especially important in the current economic climate.

At the same time, I believe that people should not be forced to work beyond 65. Everyone has different physical and mental capacities and they should be respected. Additionally, people should have the right to retire earlier if they wish and if they can afford to do so.

Finally, I believe that politicians should be held to a higher standard when it comes to retirement age. They should be encouraged to retire at the age of 65, as this is the most appropriate age for them to step down from their positions and make way for younger generations.

In conclusion, people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment until the age of 65. However, this should not be enforced and people should be allowed to retire earlier if they wish and can afford to do so. Politicians, on the other hand, should be held to a higher standard and should be encouraged to retire at 65.

Retirement age is a highly debated topic in today’s society. The retirement age is the age at which an individual is expected to stop working and is generally set by the government. The age at which people should be made to retire is a complex issue and there is no single answer to it. 

The age at which people should be made to retire largely depends on the individual’s career and health. For example, those working in physically demanding jobs such as construction workers, manual laborers, and factory workers may need to retire earlier than those in less strenuous jobs. This is because physically demanding jobs can take a toll on their health, leading to a decrease in productivity. 

On the other hand, those in less strenuous jobs may be able to continue working for longer as their health is not as affected. This means that they can continue to contribute to the economy and society for longer. Furthermore, some people may be able to continue working well into their 70s or even 80s if their health allows them to do so. 

In addition, the retirement age should also be based on an individual’s financial situation. Some people may not have enough savings to support themselves after retirement, so they may need to continue working for longer in order to build up enough savings. 

In conclusion, it is difficult to set a single retirement age for everyone as it largely depends on the individual’s career and health, as well as their financial situation. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors when deciding on the retirement age.

Today, there is a heated debate around the retirement age of senior workers. While some people insist that senior workers aged 65 or over should retire, others believe that they should continue working. In my opinion, senior workers should be allowed to continue working if they are willing and able to do so.

One argument in favor of forcing senior workers to retire is that it would open up job opportunities for younger people. This is certainly a valid point, as more job openings would provide better prospects for the younger generation. However, this argument ignores the fact that senior workers have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can be invaluable to their employers. They can offer unique insights, and can act as mentors to younger employees.

Furthermore, allowing senior workers to remain employed would be beneficial to them as well. Retirement can be a difficult transition for many, as it can lead to feelings of isolation and depression. Working provides a sense of purpose and belonging, and can help to keep senior workers active and engaged. It can also provide an additional source of income, which can be especially important for those who are struggling financially.

In conclusion, I believe that senior workers should be allowed to continue working if they are willing and able to do so. This would be beneficial to both employers and employees, as it would offer job opportunities to the younger generation while also providing senior workers with a sense of purpose and financial security.

In today's world, the amount of money being paid to international entertainers, including sports personalities, is often seen as excessive and unjustified. This is particularly true when considering the amount of poverty and inequality that exists in the world. While it is understandable that these entertainers, including sports personalities, should be compensated for their talents and hard work, it is difficult to justify the millions of dollars they often receive when so many people around the world are living in poverty.

The entertainment industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, and the salaries of its stars are often seen as a reflection of their worth. However, it is important to remember that these salaries are often out of proportion with the amount of money that is available to other people in the world. It is understandable that entertainers and sports personalities should be well-paid for their work, but it is difficult to justify the millions of dollars they often receive when there are so many people in the world living in poverty.

The money that is paid to international entertainers and sports personalities could be better spent on helping those in need. The money could be used to provide food, shelter, and healthcare to those who are living in poverty.

It is true that people are facing more pressure in their work life than ever before. With the advent of technology and the ever-increasing competition, people are expected to work harder and faster in order to stay ahead of the curve. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of leisure time that people have to relax.

On the one hand, the pressure of work can be beneficial in many ways. It encourages people to stay focused and motivated, and pushes them to reach their goals. It also helps them to hone their skills, and to be more productive. Moreover, it can result in higher salaries and better job opportunities.

On the other hand, too much pressure can be detrimental to an individual’s health and wellbeing. It can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression, and can even cause physical ailments such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and insomnia. Furthermore, it can lead to a lack of creativity and innovation, as people are too busy trying to meet deadlines and fulfill expectations.

In my opinion, it is important to strike a balance between work and leisure. We should not be so consumed by our jobs that we forget to take care of ourselves and our loved ones. We should make sure to have regular breaks from work and use our free time to relax and recharge. We should also ensure that we are not working too hard and that we are taking the necessary steps to maintain our mental and physical health.

The job market is ever-changing and with it, so are the expectations of job seekers. Some people prefer to stay in the same job for the same company for a long period of time, while others prefer to switch jobs more frequently. Both of these viewpoints have their advantages and disadvantages. 

One of the main advantages of staying in the same job for a long period of time is job security. When someone works for the same company for a long period of time, they are more likely to receive job stability and job security. This is especially beneficial in times of economic uncertainty, as the employee is unlikely to be laid off or have their hours reduced. Additionally, when someone stays in the same job for a long period of time, they are more likely to receive promotions, raises, and other perks as a result of their loyalty to the company. 

On the other hand, switching jobs more frequently can also have its advantages. One of the main advantages is the potential to increase one’s salary. When someone switches jobs more frequently, they are more likely to find jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Additionally, switching jobs more frequently can also provide someone with new opportunities to learn and develop new skills. This can be beneficial for someone’s career in the long run, as they can use these skills to move up in their career. 

However, there are also some drawbacks to both of these viewpoints. Staying in the same job for a long period of time can lead to stagnation, as the employee may not be exposed to new ideas or challenges. Additionally, staying in the same job for a long period of time can lead to complacency, as the employee may become too comfortable in their position and not strive for more. On the other hand, switching jobs more frequently can lead to instability, as the employee may not have enough time to adjust to their new job or to form relationships with their colleagues. Additionally, switching jobs more frequently can also lead to a lack of job security, as the employee may not have a consistent source of income. 

In conclusion, both of these viewpoints have their advantages and disadvantages. It is important for job seekers to consider their own personal needs and goals when deciding which viewpoint is best for them.

The debate over whether families who do not send their children to government-financed schools should be required to pay taxes that support universal education is a complex one. There are arguments on both sides of the issue. On one hand, it is argued that parents should have the freedom to choose the type of education they want for their children and should not be forced to pay for something they do not use. On the other hand, it is argued that universal education is a public good and everyone should contribute to its financing regardless of whether they use it or not. 

From an economic perspective, it is true that taxes should be used only for public goods and services that benefit everyone. However, it is also true that universal education is a public good that should be supported by everyone. It is the foundation of a strong and prosperous society and it should be accessible to all regardless of their financial situation. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that all families should contribute to its financing. 

From a social perspective, it is important to consider the impact of not requiring families who do not send their children to government-financed schools to pay taxes that support universal education. If these families are not required to contribute, it could lead to an unequal distribution of resources, with poorer families being unable to access quality education and having to rely on substandard schools. This could have a long-term impact on the development of the society, as it would create an educational divide between the rich and the poor. 

In conclusion, it is essential that all families, regardless of their financial situation, contribute to the financing of universal education. This will ensure that everyone has access to quality education and that the society can benefit from a strong and prosperous educational system.

It also ensures that the education system is funded adequately, allowing for better quality education for all. 

However, there is also a strong argument against requiring taxes to support universal education for those who do not use the government-financed school system. It could be argued that those who choose not to use the government-funded school system should not be expected to pay for it.

The idea that the government should not invest in theatres and sports stadiums and should instead allocate more money to medical care and education is a debatable topic. On the one hand, some people may argue that these are luxuries and the government should focus its resources on more important areas. On the other hand, there are those who believe that theatre and sports are essential for a healthy society and should therefore be funded by the government. 

It is true that medical care and education are essential components of any society and they should be given priority over other areas. Without adequate medical care and education, a society cannot thrive and progress. However, it is also important to recognize the importance of theatre and sports in a healthy and balanced society. Theatre and sports are not luxuries, but rather essential elements of a healthy society. They provide an outlet for creativity and expression, and also help to build a sense of community and belonging. 

The world would be a very different place without Shakespeare and the Olympics. Theatre and sports provide entertainment, inspiration and an opportunity for people to come together and celebrate. Without these forms of entertainment, people would lack the opportunity to express themselves, and the world would be a much duller place.

The cost of medical health care is a major issue of contention in many countries today. Governments are struggling to balance their health care budgets, and citizens are increasingly concerned about their own health costs. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of having citizens take out private health insurance versus having a comprehensive health care system which provides free health services for all.

The main advantage of having citizens take out private health insurance is that it allows them to have greater control over their own medical care. Individuals can choose the type of coverage they need and can tailor their plans to their own specific needs. This can be particularly beneficial for those with chronic health conditions or those who require specialized care. Additionally, private health insurance can provide more comprehensive coverage than a public health care system.

However, there are several drawbacks to having citizens take out private health insurance. Firstly, it can be expensive and may be unaffordable for some people. Furthermore, it can be difficult to find a plan that meets one’s individual needs. Finally, private health insurance does not provide the same level of coverage as a public health care system.

On the other hand, a comprehensive health care system which provides free health services for all has several advantages. Firstly, it ensures that everyone has access to the same level of health care regardless of their financial situation. Additionally, it can help to reduce the overall cost of health care by providing preventive care and reducing the burden on emergency services. Finally, it can help to reduce health disparities by making sure that everyone has access to the same level of care.

However, there are also some drawbacks to a comprehensive health care system. Firstly, it can be expensive for governments to fund, and this money may have to be diverted from other areas of public expenditure. Additionally, it can be difficult to ensure that everyone has access to the same level of care. Finally, some people may be reluctant to use the services provided by a public health care system due to the lack of choice and flexibility.

In conclusion, both private health insurance and a comprehensive health care system have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide which option is best for them. However, it is important that governments ensure that everyone has access to the same level of health care, regardless of their financial situation.

Education is a fundamental right of every individual and is key to the overall development of a nation. It is often said that education should be free to all people and paid for by the government. While I agree that education should be accessible to all, I do not agree with the notion that it should be completely free and paid for by the government. 

Firstly, providing free education to all citizens is a huge financial burden on the government. This could result in a lot of strain on the government’s resources and could potentially lead to other important services being neglected. The government could instead use the money to improve existing educational infrastructure, provide scholarships and grants to those who are in need, and create more job opportunities. 

Secondly, free education may result in a lack of motivation among students and teachers. If there is no cost associated with education, students may not take it seriously and may not put in the required effort to excel. Similarly, teachers may not be motivated to deliver quality education if they are not adequately compensated. 

Finally, free education may lead to overcrowding in educational institutions. With no cost involved, more and more people may opt for higher education, resulting in a shortage of resources. This could lead to a decrease in the quality of education and an increase in the dropout rate. 

In conclusion, I believe that while education should be accessible to all, it should not be completely free and paid for by the government. Instead, the government should focus on creating more job opportunities and providing scholarships and grants to those who are in need. This would help ensure that quality education is accessible to all, without putting a strain on the government’s resources.

Writing fiction is a creative art form, and it can often be difficult for writers to make a living from their work. In this essay, I will discuss whether the government should provide financial assistance to writers of fiction in order to encourage good literature.

On the one hand, it could be argued that the government should provide financial assistance to writers of fiction in order to encourage good literature. Writers often struggle to earn enough money from their writing to make a living, and financial assistance could help them to focus on creating quality work. This could also help to encourage more people to pursue writing as a career, as they would be more likely to be able to make a living from it. Furthermore, providing financial assistance to writers could help to ensure that more diverse voices are represented in literature, as it could enable writers from marginalized backgrounds to pursue writing without worrying about their financial security.

On the other hand, it could be argued that the government should not provide financial assistance to writers of fiction. This is because it could be difficult to determine who should receive financial assistance, and it could be difficult to ensure that the money is used in the most effective way. Furthermore, it could be argued that providing financial assistance to writers could lead to a decrease in the quality of literature, as writers may become too reliant on the assistance and not push themselves to create the best possible work.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should provide financial assistance to writers of fiction in order to encourage good literature. This could help to ensure that more diverse voices are represented in literature, and it could also help to ensure that writers are able to focus on creating quality work. However, it is important to ensure that the money is used in the most effective way, and that it does not lead to a decrease in the quality of literature.

The debate over whether citizens should be responsible for their own health costs by taking out private health insurance or have a comprehensive health care system that provides free health services to all has been a contentious issue for many years. On one hand, those who advocate for private health insurance argue that individuals should be responsible for their own health costs and that a comprehensive health care system is too expensive and unsustainable. On the other hand, proponents of a comprehensive health care system argue that it is the responsibility of the government to provide free health services to all citizens, regardless of their financial situation.

It is understandable why some may argue for private health insurance as a way to reduce the costs of health care for individuals. By taking out private health insurance, individuals can offset the cost of medical treatments and procedures, which can often be expensive. Furthermore, private health insurance can provide access to a wider range of health care services, which may not be available in a comprehensive health care system.

However, there are several reasons why a comprehensive health care system is preferable. Firstly, it ensures that all citizens have access to health care, regardless of their financial situation. This is especially important for those who are unable to afford private health insurance, such as the elderly, the disabled, and those on low incomes. Secondly, a comprehensive health care system can help to reduce the overall cost of health care, as the government can negotiate better rates with health care providers and pharmaceutical companies. Finally, a comprehensive health care system can help to reduce the burden of health care costs on individuals, as they do not have to worry about the cost of medical treatments and procedures.

In conclusion, while private health insurance can provide individuals with access to a wider range of health care services and can help to reduce the cost of medical treatments and procedures, a comprehensive health care system is preferable. It ensures that all citizens have access to health care, regardless of their financial situation, and can help to reduce the overall cost of health care. Therefore, it is better for governments to provide free health services for all citizens, rather than relying on individuals to take out private health insurance.

In the modern world, governments face a myriad of issues and concerns, ranging from health and education to infrastructure and public safety. As a result, many people believe that governments should focus their financial resources on these more pressing matters, rather than on art. While this is understandable, I strongly disagree with this opinion and believe that governments should devote a portion of their funds to art and culture.

Firstly, art and culture are essential components of a nation's identity and heritage. From ancient artifacts to modern works of art, these creations tell the story of a nation's past and present. By investing in art, governments can ensure that these stories are preserved and passed down to future generations. Furthermore, by investing in art and culture, governments can create jobs and stimulate the economy. This can be especially beneficial in areas that are economically disadvantaged, as it can create new opportunities for people to work and earn a living.

Moreover, art can be a powerful tool for social change. It can be used to spread awareness of important issues, such as social injustice, poverty, and environmental degradation. By investing in art, governments can encourage the production of works that can help to drive positive change in society. Additionally, art can be used to bring people together and foster a sense of community and belonging. This is especially important in times of conflict and tension, when art can be used to bridge divides and promote understanding and cooperation.

In conclusion, while governments have many important issues and concerns to address, they should also devote a portion of their funds to art and culture. Art can be used to preserve a nation's heritage, create jobs, and drive social change. It can also be used to bring people together and foster a sense of community. For these reasons, governments should invest in art and culture, even in the face of other pressing matters.

The use of security cameras in public places has become increasingly common in the fight against crime. While some people argue that this is an invasion of our privacy, I believe that it can be beneficial in helping to reduce crime, and that the benefits outweigh the costs.

On the one hand, the use of security cameras in public places can be seen as a violation of our right to privacy. We should all be able to go about our daily lives without feeling as though we are under constant surveillance. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the footage collected by the cameras will not be misused or abused in some way.

On the other hand, there is no denying that security cameras can be a useful tool in the fight against crime. By having cameras in public places, police forces are able to monitor and track criminal activity, making it easier to apprehend criminals and prevent crime from occurring in the first place. Furthermore, the presence of security cameras can act as a deterrent to potential criminals, as they know that their activities are being monitored.

In conclusion, while security cameras in public places can be seen as an invasion of our privacy, I believe that the benefits they provide in terms of reducing crime outweigh the costs. Therefore, I believe that the use of security cameras in public places should be encouraged.

The concept of governments regulating the number of children a family can have is a controversial one. On the one hand, some argue that it is a necessary step to control the population, while on the other hand, some believe that it is an infringement of basic human rights. In my opinion, I agree that it is sometimes necessary and right for a government to control the population in this way.

To begin with, it is undeniable that population growth can have a detrimental effect on the environment and resources. In densely populated countries, there is a risk of overpopulation, leading to a strain on resources, such as food, water, energy, and other basic necessities. This can lead to a decrease in the quality of life, as well as an increase in poverty and crime. By implementing a policy that limits the number of children a family can have, governments can help to reduce the strain on resources and ensure that the quality of life is maintained.

Furthermore, the implementation of such a policy can also help to reduce the risk of poverty. As the cost of raising a child continues to increase, many families are unable to support the number of children they would like to have. By limiting the number of children a family can have, governments can help to ensure that families are not struggling to provide for their children. Additionally, this policy can also help to ensure that children are provided with a good education, as families can focus their resources on fewer children.

Finally, it is important to consider the ethical implications of such a policy. While it is necessary to control the population, it is also important to ensure that basic human rights are not violated. To this end, governments should ensure that the policy is implemented in a fair and equitable manner, and that families are given adequate support to ensure that their rights are not infringed upon.

In conclusion, I believe that it is sometimes necessary and right for a government to control the population in this way. By implementing a policy that limits the number of children a family can have, governments can help to reduce the strain on resources and ensure that the quality of life is maintained. Additionally, this policy can also help to reduce the risk of poverty and ensure that children are provided with a good education.

The world is becoming increasingly reliant on technology, and as a result, computers are replacing more and more jobs. This means that many professions that used to require a human touch are now being taken over by machines. Some of the job positions that may be lost due to the advancement of computers include administrative assistants, customer service representatives, and even some medical professionals.

One of the main problems that may arise from computers taking over these jobs is a lack of human interaction. Many people rely on the interaction they have with customer service representatives, medical professionals, and other service providers in order to feel connected and supported. Without this human connection, many people may feel isolated and lonely. This could lead to an increase in mental health issues, as well as an overall decrease in quality of life.

Another problem is the potential for job loss. If computers are taking over more and more jobs, there will be fewer positions available for human workers. This could lead to an increase in unemployment and poverty, as people will not be able to find work to support themselves. Furthermore, this could lead to an increase in inequality as those with the skills to work with computers will be able to find work, while those without these skills will be left behind.

Finally, computers taking over more and more jobs could lead to a decrease in wages. If a computer can do the same job as a human, employers may be less willing to pay a human wage for the same job. This could lead to a decrease in the overall standard of living, as people will not be able to earn enough to support themselves.

In conclusion, as computers become increasingly advanced, more and more jobs are being replaced by machines. This could lead to a lack of human interaction, an increase in unemployment and poverty, and a decrease in wages. It is important to consider the potential consequences of this shift to ensure that everyone is able to benefit from the advancement of technology.

The use of computers in the education system has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades. Some people argue that this will eventually lead to the demise of teachers in the classroom, leaving computers to take over the entire teaching process. However, this is an overly simplistic view of the situation, as there are a number of reasons why computers will never fully replace teachers in the classroom.

To begin with, computers are unable to provide the same level of emotional support and guidance that a teacher can. Teachers are able to build relationships with their students, providing them with the necessary encouragement and motivation to succeed. This is something that computers cannot do, as they lack the ability to understand and respond to emotional cues. Furthermore, teachers are able to provide personalized instruction, tailoring their lessons to the individual needs of each student. This is something that computers are unable to do, as they are unable to adjust their teaching style to suit different students.

In addition to this, computers are unable to provide the same level of feedback and assessment as a teacher can. Teachers are able to provide students with immediate feedback on their work, allowing them to identify and address any mistakes they may have made. This is something that computers are unable to do, as they are unable to provide the same level of detailed analysis. Furthermore, teachers are able to provide students with guidance and advice on how to improve their work, something that computers are unable to do.

Finally, computers are unable to provide the same level of inspiration and enthusiasm as a teacher can. Teachers are able to bring their lessons to life, creating an engaging and stimulating learning environment. This is something that computers are unable to do, as they lack the ability to generate enthusiasm and excitement in the classroom.

Nowadays, traffic and housing problems in major cities are becoming more and more serious, and people have proposed various solutions to this problem. One of the solutions is to move large companies and factories and their employees to the countryside. However, I do not fully agree with this opinion.

On the one hand, moving large companies and factories to the countryside could help to reduce the traffic congestion in major cities. This is because fewer people will be commuting to and from work, and this in turn will lead to fewer cars on the roads, thus reducing the amount of traffic. Moreover, the relocation of factories and companies would also help to reduce the amount of air pollution in major cities, as the factories would be producing their goods in the countryside, away from the cities.

On the other hand, I do not think that this solution would be effective in solving the housing problems in major cities. Even if the factories and companies were moved to the countryside, the employees would still need to live in the cities, as they would need to be close to their workplaces. This means that the demand for housing in the cities would still remain high, and the housing prices would not go down. Furthermore, the relocation of factories and companies to the countryside would bring about a lot of disruption to the lives of the employees, as they would have to move away from their homes and families.

It leads to loss of productive time, causes air pollution, wastes precious fuel and also leads to accidents. But all is not lost, there are a number of ways to reduce the number of cars on the road.

One way that could offer an immediate solution to this problem is to increase the use of public transport. There is a need to expand the public transport network and make it more affordable and comfortable. The government should focus on introducing more buses and trains, and also incentivize their use. There should also be a greater emphasis on encouraging people to use alternative modes of transport such as cycles, scooters and e-rickshaws. This could be done by offering discounts on public transport tickets and offering incentives for those who use these modes of transport.

The government can also introduce a range of measures to restrict the use of cars on the roads. Carpooling is one of the most effective ways to reduce congestion on the roads. This could be implemented through an online platform where drivers and passengers can register and travel in the same vehicle. The government should also introduce a congestion charge for those using cars during peak hours. This would encourage drivers to use public transport or carpool during this time.

Additionally, we should focus on the bigger picture and promote alternative forms of transport. This could be done by introducing incentives for manufacturers who focus on electric vehicles and encouraging people to switch to electric cars. Incentives could also be offered to those who invest in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.

Finally, we should focus on educating motorists regarding the importance of reducing their use of cars on the roads. This can be done through comprehensive campaigns in the media and by providing drivers with tips and advice about controlling their use of cars. This can also be done by involving the wider community in order to promote a car-free lifestyle. 

In conclusion, reducing the number of cars on the roads can be achieved through various measures. These include an increased use of public transport, greater emphasis on alternative modes of transport, carpooling, congestion charges and focusing on renewable energy sources.

This assistance can come in the form of providing educational resources, such as textbooks and computers, as well as offering financial support to help pay for school fees and other educational expenses.

Trade is also an important factor in the development of poorer nations, and the governments of richer nations should provide assistance in helping poorer nations to increase their exports. This assistance can come in the form of offering financial support to help poorer nations to purchase the necessary resources and equipment to produce goods, as well as providing technical assistance in helping them to develop the necessary skills to compete in the global marketplace.

In conclusion, it is clear that the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in health, education, and trade. Such assistance can come in the form of providing medical supplies and equipment, training medical personnel, offering financial support to ensure that health services are accessible to everyone, providing educational resources, offering financial support to help pay for school fees and other educational expenses, and providing financial and technical support to help poorer nations to increase their exports. Such assistance is essential to ensure a more equitable global society.

The wealth gap between first world countries and third world countries is a cause of major concern. The disparity between rich and poor is increasing at an alarming rate and it is becoming more and more difficult to bridge the gap. Developed countries have a responsibility to help developing nations in every way they can.

One way to reduce the wealth gap is to increase the amount of foreign aid given to developing nations. This can be done by increasing the amount of money that is given to these countries and also by providing them with resources and technical assistance. This will help to create economic opportunities and create jobs in these countries. This will help to reduce income inequality and create a more equal distribution of wealth.

Another way to reduce the wealth gap is to create trade agreements between developed countries and developing nations. This will allow for the export of goods and services from the developed countries to the developing countries. This will create economic opportunities in the developing countries and will help to reduce poverty.

Finally, it is important to ensure that the money that is sent to developing countries is used effectively. This means making sure that the money is used to create sustainable economic opportunities and to create jobs. This will help to reduce poverty and create more equal distribution of wealth.

In conclusion, it is clear that developed countries have a duty to assist developing countries in every way they can. This includes increasing foreign aid, creating trade agreements and ensuring that the money is used effectively. This will help to reduce the wealth gap between first world countries and third world countries and create a more equal distribution of wealth.

In the world today, there is a great disparity between the rich and the poor countries. Rich countries are those with high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, while the poorer countries are those with low GDP per capita. This divide between the rich and the poor has been a major source of debate and contention, especially in the context of whether the rich countries should help the poorer ones. It is argued that helping the poorer countries will only make them dependent on the rich countries and will not benefit them in the long run. On the other hand, some argue that the rich countries have a moral obligation to help the poorer countries, and that it will benefit both the countries in the long run. 

The proponents of the idea that rich countries should help the poorer ones suggest that the rich countries have the resources and the means to do so. They argue that the rich countries should use their resources to help the poorer countries out of poverty, and that this will help the world become a better place. They also point out that the rich countries have a moral obligation to help the poorer countries, and that they should use their resources to do so. 

On the other hand, the opponents of the idea that rich countries should help the poorer ones suggest that this will only make the poorer countries dependent on the rich countries. They argue that the poorer countries should be able to stand on their own feet and should not be reliant on the help of the richer countries. They also argue that the money and resources given to the poorer countries will only end up in the hands of corrupt leaders, and that the money will not be used to benefit the people of the poorer countries. 

In my opinion, I believe that rich countries should help the poorer ones, but in a way that does not make the poorer countries dependent on the richer countries. The money and resources given to the poorer countries should be used to help them become self-sufficient and independent. This could be done by providing educational and healthcare facilities, as well as providing financial aid to help them build their own economy. This will help the poorer countries become self-sufficient and independent, and will benefit both the countries in the long run. 

In conclusion, I believe that the rich countries should help the poorer ones, but in a way that does not make them dependent on the richer countries. This will benefit both the countries in the long run, and will help create a better world.

Leisure time is a precious commodity in our increasingly busy lives. While some people believe that leisure time should be used to engage in activities that stimulate the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles, others believe that it is important to rest the mind during this time. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and explain why I believe it is important to strike a balance between the two. 

On the one hand, it is important to use leisure time to engage in activities that improve the mind. Reading is an excellent example of this. Reading books, magazines, and newspapers can help to expand our knowledge and understanding of the world. Furthermore, engaging in word puzzles such as crosswords and Sudoku can help to improve our problem-solving skills and logical thinking. These activities can help us to stay mentally sharp and alert, and can even help to reduce the risk of developing dementia in later life. 

On the other hand, it is also important to rest the mind during leisure time. This can involve activities such as listening to music, watching television, or taking a nap. These activities can help us to relax and unwind after a long day, and can help us to recharge our batteries and prepare for the next day. Furthermore, taking time out to relax can help to reduce stress and anxiety, and can even help to improve our physical health. 

In conclusion, I believe it is important to strike a balance between engaging in activities that stimulate the mind, and taking time out to rest the mind. Both activities are important for our overall wellbeing, and both should be included in our leisure time.

In today’s busy world, it is important to have some free time to relax and recharge. People often have different approaches to how they use their free time. Some people prefer to plan activities for their free time very carefully, while others choose not to make any plans at all. Both of these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages. 

One of the benefits of planning activities for free time is that it can help to ensure that time is used in a productive and meaningful way. Planning activities can help to prevent procrastination, as it gives people something concrete to focus on. For example, if a person plans to learn a new language during their free time, they can break down the activity into manageable chunks and work on it in a systematic way. This can lead to a sense of achievement when the task is completed. 

On the other hand, not making any plans for free time can also be beneficial. This approach allows people to be spontaneous and open to new experiences. People who do not plan their free time can take advantage of unexpected opportunities that come their way. For example, if a person is invited to a party at the last minute, they can attend without having to rearrange their plans. This approach can also lead to a sense of freedom, as people do not have to stick to a rigid schedule. 

In my opinion, I prefer to plan activities for my free time. I find that planning helps me to make the most of my time, and it also gives me a sense of satisfaction when I complete a task. With careful planning, it is possible to balance work and leisure and still have enough time to relax. However, I also understand the benefits of not making plans, and I am willing to be flexible and take advantage of unexpected opportunities. 

In conclusion, planning activities for free time can help to ensure that time is used in a productive and meaningful way. On the other hand, not making any plans can lead to unexpected opportunities and a sense of freedom. I prefer to plan activities for my free time, as it helps me to make the most of my time.

The statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit is a highly contested one. Some people believe that businesses should prioritize profits over other considerations, while others argue that businesses should be held to a higher ethical standard. In my opinion, businesses should prioritize profits, but they should also take into account ethical considerations.

On the one hand, businesses should prioritize profits. Businesses exist to generate profits and to do so, they must make decisions that will maximize their profits. This means that businesses should strive to cut costs, increase efficiency, and find new ways to increase revenue. If businesses fail to prioritize profits, they will not be able to stay afloat and will eventually go out of business.

On the other hand, businesses should also take into account ethical considerations. There are certain practices, such as exploiting workers or using dangerous chemicals, that are ethically wrong and should not be tolerated. Businesses should not be allowed to engage in such practices, even if it means sacrificing some of their profits. Furthermore, businesses should also strive to be good corporate citizens and contribute to the well-being of their local communities.

In conclusion, businesses should prioritize profits, but they should also take into account ethical considerations. Businesses should be allowed to make profits, but they should also be held to a higher standard and should strive to be good corporate citizens. Only then can businesses be successful and contribute to the well-being of their communities.

Nowadays, cars have become an integral part of our lives. They provide us with convenience, comfort and freedom to travel wherever we want. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages of having a car. 

The biggest advantage of having a car is that it provides us with the freedom to travel wherever we want without relying on public transport. We can go to work, to the grocery store, to visit friends and family and to explore new places with ease. We can also save time and money by avoiding public transport fares and waiting times. Furthermore, cars are equipped with modern safety features, such as airbags and anti-lock brakes, which make them safer than other modes of transport. 

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of having a car. The most obvious one is the cost of ownership. Cars are expensive to purchase, maintain and fuel. Additionally, cars contribute to air pollution, noise pollution and traffic congestion. This is especially true in cities, where the number of cars is increasing at an alarming rate. Finally, driving a car can be dangerous if you are not a responsible driver. 

In conclusion, cars have both advantages and disadvantages. However, if you can afford the cost of ownership and are a responsible driver, then owning a car can be a great way to enjoy the convenience and freedom of travel.

The debate regarding the major influence on our personality and development has been ongoing for many years. While some argue that our experiences in life have a greater impact on our development, research indicates that the characteristics we are born with are much more influential. In my opinion, the major influence on our personality and development is the characteristics we are born with. 

The primary reason for my opinion is that our genetic makeup determines our physical and mental characteristics. This is particularly evident in the case of physical traits such as height, weight and eye color, which are determined by our genes. Similarly, our mental characteristics such as intelligence, creativity and emotional stability are also largely determined by our genetic makeup. These characteristics form the foundation of our personality and have a significant impact on our development. For example, an individual with a higher level of intelligence is more likely to succeed in school and in their career than someone with a lower level of intelligence.

In addition, the characteristics we are born with can also influence our behavior. For instance, an individual who is born with a predisposition to be aggressive is more likely to engage in aggressive behavior than someone who is not. Similarly, an individual who is born with a predisposition to be shy is more likely to be introverted than someone who is not. These behavioral tendencies are largely determined by our genetic makeup and can have a significant impact on our personality and development. 

On the other hand, while our experiences in life can also have an impact on our personality and development, they are not as influential as the characteristics we are born with. For example, an individual who is born with a predisposition to be shy may become more extroverted as a result of positive experiences in life. However, this is not likely to happen if the individual is not born with the predisposition to be extroverted in the first place. In other words, our experiences in life can only have a limited influence on our personality and development.

In conclusion, while our experiences in life can have some influence on our personality and development, the major influence is the characteristics we are born with. Our genetic makeup determines our physical and mental characteristics, which form the foundation of our personality and have a significant impact on our development. Therefore, it is clear that the major influence on our personality and development is the characteristics we are born with.

Decisions are an integral part of our lives that shape our future. It is important to make the right decision, and there are different opinions on whether a person should make an important decision alone or not. I believe that it is not wise to make an important decision alone, and there are several reasons to support this opinion. 

First and foremost, making a decision alone can lead to wrong decisions due to lack of unbiased opinion. A person can be biased due to their own personal preferences or beliefs. Therefore, it is important to consider the opinion of others to make a reasonable decision. For example, if a person is deciding between two job offers, they should seek the advice of their friends and family to make the right decision. 

Moreover, making decisions alone can lead to loneliness and isolation. When a person makes an important decision alone, they may feel isolated and lonely, as they don’t have anyone to share their thoughts and feelings with. This can lead to depression and other mental health issues. Therefore, it is important to involve others in making important decisions, so that the person can feel supported and have someone to share their thoughts and feelings with. 

Finally, making decisions alone can lead to burnout due to lack of support. Making decisions alone can be stressful and overwhelming, as the person does not have anyone to share the burden of making the decision. This can lead to mental and physical exhaustion, as the person does not have anyone to support them and provide them with the necessary resources. Therefore, it is important to involve others in making important decisions to reduce the burden of making the decision. 

In conclusion, I believe that it is not wise to make an important decision alone. Making decisions alone can lead to wrong decisions due to lack of unbiased opinion, loneliness and isolation, and burnout due to lack of support. Therefore, it is important to involve others in making important decisions to make the right decision and reduce the burden of making the decision.

Living in a community means being part of a larger collective. It is important to give back to the community that has given us so much. That is why I have decided to give several hours of my time each month to improve the community where I live. 

I plan to volunteer my time at a local homeless shelter. Homelessness is a growing problem in my community, and I believe that by volunteering my time, I can help make a difference. I will be helping the homeless by serving meals, providing basic necessities such as clothing and toiletries, and helping them with job applications. I also plan to help the shelter with administrative tasks such as filing paperwork, answering phones, and organizing donations. 

I believe this is an important way to improve my community because it will help those who are struggling the most. Homelessness is a complex issue with many causes, and by helping those who are homeless, I can help make a positive impact in my community. Additionally, I will be providing a valuable service to those who are in need. By providing meals, clothing, and other basic necessities, I will be able to make a difference in the lives of many people. 

Finally, volunteering at a homeless shelter will also help me gain valuable experience. I will learn about the complexities of homelessness, as well as the importance of giving back to the community. I will also gain experience in working with people from different backgrounds and in different situations.

Living in a small town in the northern part of India, I have seen the town grow and develop over the years. However, there is one thing that I would like to change about my hometown if given the chance; the lack of public transport.

Public transport is an essential part of any city or town. It is the most convenient way for people to get around without having to rely on their own vehicles. Unfortunately, my hometown does not have a public transport system. The only mode of public transport available is auto-rickshaws, which are often unreliable and expensive. As a result, people are forced to use their own vehicles, leading to increased traffic congestion and air pollution.

Apart from being a hassle, the lack of public transport also affects the lives of people in my hometown. Many people are unable to access jobs, education and other essential services due to the lack of public transport. This has resulted in high unemployment rates and low educational standards.

The introduction of an efficient public transport system would be a great boon to the people of my hometown. It would allow people to access jobs, education and other essential services with ease. It would also reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, making the town a more pleasant place to live.

To ensure the success of a public transport system, the government needs to invest in infrastructure and provide subsidies for users. The government should also ensure that the public transport system is reliable and affordable. This will encourage more people to use public transport, resulting in fewer cars on the roads and less air pollution.

In conclusion, the introduction of a public transport system in my hometown would have numerous benefits. It would make the town a more pleasant place to live, while also allowing people to access essential services with ease. I believe that the government should invest in public transport and provide subsidies to make it more accessible to the people of my hometown.

If I had to recommend one location for a foreign visitor to spend one day in my country, I would suggest a visit to the Taj Mahal. This iconic monument is one of the most recognizable landmarks in India, and it is a must-see for any visitor. 

The Taj Mahal is a 17th century mausoleum built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is a stunningly beautiful structure, made of white marble and decorated with intricate inlay work. The Taj Mahal is surrounded by lush gardens and a reflecting pool, making it a peaceful and serene spot to spend the day. 

Visitors to the Taj Mahal can take a guided tour of the grounds and the building, learning about its history and architecture. They can also explore the surrounding gardens and take in the stunning views of the monument from different angles. The Taj Mahal is also a great place to take photographs, as it provides a unique and beautiful backdrop for any picture. 

The Taj Mahal is also a great place to learn about Indian culture and history. It is a symbol of love and devotion, and a reminder of the grandeur of the Mughal Empire. It is also a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the artisans who worked on it, and a reminder of the beauty of Indian architecture. 

For these reasons, I would recommend that a foreign visitor spend one day at the Taj Mahal. It is a beautiful and iconic monument, and a great place to learn about India’s history and culture. It is also a great place to take pictures and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere.

Sports is a form of entertainment and a passion for many. It is a field where success is determined by hard work, dedication, and perseverance. But, it is also a field where professionals can earn an enormous amount of money. While some people think this is fully justified, others think it is unfair. 

On one hand, there are those who believe that sports professionals deserve to be paid more than people in other professions. They argue that sports professionals put in a great deal of effort and time to perfect their skills and achieve success. They also have to maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay away from any form of doping or cheating. Moreover, they have to put in a lot of time and energy to stay fit and perform at their peak. Hence, they deserve to be rewarded for their hard work. 

On the other hand, there are those who think it is unfair for sports professionals to be paid more than people in other professions. They argue that there are many other important professions such as doctors, teachers, and scientists who make a huge contribution to society. These professionals are not paid as much as sports professionals, yet they are equally important. Hence, it is not right to pay sports professionals more than people in other professions. 

In my opinion, I think that sports professionals should be rewarded for their hard work and dedication. They put in a lot of effort and time to perfect their skills and achieve success. However, I also believe that the amount of money they earn should be proportional to the amount of effort they put in. People in other professions should also be paid a fair wage for their hard work and dedication.

The contributions of both artists and scientists are invaluable to society. Artists are often credited with the ability to evoke emotion and to inspire creativity in others, while scientists are seen as the pioneers of progress and innovation. It is difficult to say which type of contribution is valued more by society as both are integral to the advancement of humanity.

When it comes to the contributions of artists, they have the power to influence the world in a positive way. Through their work, they are able to express their views and opinions, which can lead to social change. Art can also be used to educate and inform people, as well as to entertain them. Moreover, art can be used to bring people together and promote understanding between different cultures and countries.

On the other hand, scientists are responsible for the advancements in technology, medicine, and other fields. They are the ones who push the boundaries of knowledge and discover new ways to improve our lives. For example, scientists have developed vaccines to fight diseases, and they are also responsible for the development of renewable energy sources. Scientists also help us better understand the world around us and make informed decisions about the environment and our health.

In my opinion, both types of contributions are equally valued by society. Without the work of scientists, we would not have the technologies and advancements that we have today. Similarly, without the work of artists, we would not have the same level of creativity and inspiration. Both artists and scientists provide essential contributions to our society and it is difficult to say which type of contribution is valued more.

The debate about whether people who have original ideas are of greater value to society than those who are merely able to replicate the ideas of others has been ongoing for some time. It is certainly true that those who can think creatively and come up with new and innovative ideas can have a major impact on society, but it would be wrong to discount the importance of those who are able to replicate the ideas of others.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that those who can think creatively and come up with original ideas can have a major impact on society. This is because they are able to introduce new ways of doing things, which can lead to progress and development. For example, entrepreneurs who come up with new business ideas can create jobs and help to boost the economy. Similarly, scientists who come up with new theories and inventions can help to improve our quality of life. It is clear, then, that those with original ideas can make a significant contribution to society.

On the other hand, however, it would be wrong to discount the importance of those who are able to replicate the ideas of others. This is because being able to replicate the ideas of others is an important skill in itself, and can be just as valuable as coming up with original ideas. For example, those who are able to replicate the ideas of others in the workplace can help to implement new projects and processes, which can be just as important as coming up with the ideas in the first place. In addition, those who are able to replicate the ideas of others can help to spread knowledge and understanding, which can be beneficial to society.

In conclusion, while it is true that those who can come up with original ideas can have a major impact on society, it would be wrong to discount the importance of those who are able to replicate the ideas of others. Both types of people can make a valuable contribution to society, and should be valued accordingly.
