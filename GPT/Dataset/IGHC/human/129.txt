Mandatory retirement age varies from society to society, perhaps a reflection of
economics, population pressures or simply value systems. Indeed, retirement at 50 can
probably be as easily justified as that at 70. It is my belief, however, that the longer an
able person is allowed to work, the better for both the individual worker and the employer.
Chronological age is not always a true indicator of ability. While some 65Â¬ year-olds may
not perform as well as they did in their past, many workers at this age do just as well or
better than they used to. People's suitability for a position should be a reflection of their
performance in the job, rather than the number of wrinkles or grey hairs they have.
Employers concerned about the increasing age of their employees need only observe
their work records. Those doing poorly may be asked to retire, but those as yet unaffected
by age should stay on. Indeed, it would appear economical for an organisation to retain its
older employees when possible rather than spend time and money on training new
workers.
Remaining in one's job for as long as one is able makes sense as life expectancies
increase around the world. As people live longer, they are longer able to contribute to
society in the form of meaningful work. But they are also in need of income for a longer
period, so a mandatory retirement age of 55 for someone who is statistically likely to live
to 77 becomes increasingly difficult to justify. At a time when populations are ageing,
governments are less able to provide for their senior citizens, so by keeping able workers
in paid employment for as long as is practicable, public expenditures are less strained.
Thus, workers who can still demonstrate their capacity to carry out their work should not
be asked to retire simply because they have reached a certain age. Societies that insist
on early retirement may do well to look again at their policies.
