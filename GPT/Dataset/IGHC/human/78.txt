It is certainly true that the position of women in society has undergone a dramatic change
in the past twenty years but I do not feel that this is a direct cause of the indisputable
increase in juvenile-related problems during this period.
It is now accepted that young women should find work on leaving school; indeed to rely
totally on their parents' financial support is no longer an option in many families. Likewise,
once they get married, the majority of women continue working since the financial
pressures of setting up a house and establishing a reasonable standard of living often
require two incomes.
Twenty years ago it was common for women to give up work once they had children and
devote their time to caring for their children. This is no longer the general rule and the
provision of professionally-run child care facilities and day nurseries have removed much
of the responsibility for child rearing that used to fall to mothers. However, these facilities
come at a cost and often require two salaries coming into a family to be afforded.
I do not believe that the increase in the number of working mothers has resulted in
children being brought up less well than previously. Indeed it could be argued that by
giving mothers the opportunity to work and earn extra money children can be better
provided for than previously. There is more money for luxuries and holidays and a more
secure family life is possible. Of course there are limits as to the amount of time that
ideally should be spent away from home and the ideal scenario would be for one of the
parents (often the wife) to have a part-time job and thus be available for their children
before and after school. It is important to establish the correct balance between family life
and working life.
