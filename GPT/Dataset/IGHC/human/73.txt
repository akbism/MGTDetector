As human population is significantly rising every year, people's requirements are
increasing too. We need more food, more machines, more place to live. As a result of this
people need more land to satisfy their requirements. We cultivate and irrigate more and
more land to plant vegetables, build new buildings, airports, roads, etc. I think sometimes
we forget that we are not alone on this planet. I have to disagree with those people who
think that human needs are more important than saving land for endangered animals. I
base my opinion on the following points.
First of all, as I already mentioned, we are not alone on this planet. A few centuries ago
we were the part of wild nature. I think we need to remember this fact and respect all
creatures around us.
Second of all, I believe that we all need to think of the problem of overpopulation. The
human population is dramatically increasing and we have to do something about it. From
my opinion, every family should have no more than two children. It will help to stop the
growth of population, decrease human needs for farmland, housing and industry.
In conclusion, I think it is a very topical question nowadays. My point is that all people
should answer this question and find the solution.
