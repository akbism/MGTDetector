Most of the firms, organization and companies as well as Government make restrictions to
smoke in work places and public amenities respectively. It has become fashionable in the
world today to blame smoking. However, although I feel that smoking can be harmful, but
I donâ€™t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have
the right whether they smoke or not.
Let me deal with the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many
people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset owing to
debt or they have exam, like to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. Most of the
people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments
throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained
from taxes provide funds which are used for building school, hospital and public places
such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also
employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries
like Zimbabwe or India. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.
Despite these positive effects there are lots of negative effects of smoking too. Initially,
smoking has been proven to be too dangerous for health. As one cigarette contain more
then 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it causes for many injurious diseases like heart
attacks, asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer and cough. According to the current report, in
Britain about 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed
by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs government millions of dollars because of the
large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems.
Moreover, there is also concern today about passive smoking. Recent research shows
that non-smokers can suffer health problems if they spend long period of time among
people who do smoke. In UK children whose parents are smoke are three times as likely
to start smoking themselves.
In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the
decision as to whether smoke or not should be for each individual to make. I suggest
people should not smoke in a room or place where there are non smokers but surely they
should be free to smoke elsewhere.
