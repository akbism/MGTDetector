People attend college for a lot of different reasons. I believe that the three most common
reasons are to prepare for a career, to have new experiences, and to increase their
knowledge of themselves and of the world around them.
Career preparation is probably the primary reason that people attend college. These
days, the job market is very competitive. Careers such as information technology will
need many new workers in the near future. At college, students can learn new skills for
these careers and increase their opportunities for the future.
Students also go to college to have new experiences. For many, it is their first time away
from home. At college, they can meet new people from many different places. They can
see what life is like in a different city. They can learn to live on their own and take care of
themselves without having their family always nearby.
At college, students have the opportunity to increase their knowledge. As they decide
what they want to study, pursue their studies, and interact with their classmates, they
learn a lot about themselves. They also, of course, have the opportunity to learn about
many subjects in their classes. In addition to the skills and knowledge related to their
career, college students also have the chance to take classes in other areas. For many,
this will be their last chance to study different subjects.
Colleges offer much more than career preparation. They offer the opportunity to have new
experiences and to learn many kinds of things. I think all of these are reasons why people
attend college.
