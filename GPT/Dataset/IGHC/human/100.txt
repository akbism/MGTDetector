I am not surprise when I read in the newspapers that many people move to English
speaking countries. I am an engineer in a process control since ten years and I
understand the necessity of English language. For example, when I read technical
English specifications, when I meet Japanese Industrials to build together some electronic
materials or when I go on holidays in Italy where the best way (for me) to communicate is
to speak English. Therefore, today, it's necessary to learn English and the best way is to
study in English as soon as possible when we are at school but also when we have a job.
It's so Important to communicate with foreigners, because of work. For example: to
seafoods in USA, to build electronic cards with the Japanese, to obtain a certification with
FDA (American organization) in order to sell some pharmaceutical products. In fact, jt's
Important for everybody, the workers, the visitors, the scientists, etc ...
These are the main reason which explain why so many people go to English speaking
countries (the best way to learn) and why English is such an Important International
language (the communication between many the people over the world).
