Every day, thousands of people are saved from painful diseases and death by powerful
medical drugs and treatments. This incredible gift of medicine would not be possible
without animal testing. Despite these overwhelming benefits, however, some people are
calling for animal testing to be banned because of alleged cruelty. This essay will examine
arguments for and against animal testing.
Those against the use of animal testing claim that it is inhumane to use animals in
experiments. I disagree completely. It would be much more inhumane to test new drugs
on children or adults. Even if it were possible, it would also take much longer to see
potential effects, because of the length of time we live compared to laboratory animals
such as rats or rabbits.
Opponents of animal testing also claim that the results are not applicable to humans. This
may be partly true. Some drugs have had to be withdrawn, despite testing. However, we
simply do not have alternative methods of testing. Computer models are not advanced
enough, and testing on plants is much less applicable to humans than tests on animals
such as monkeys. Until we have a better system, we must use animal testing.
A further point often raised against animal testing is that it is cruel. Some of the tests
certainly seem painful, but the great majority of people on this planet eat meat or wear
leather without any guilt. Where is their sympathy for animals? Furthermore, animals
clearly do not feel the same way as humans, and scientists are careful to minimize stress
in the animals, since this would damage their research.
I agree that we need to make sure that animals who are used for testing new products
have the minimum of suffering. However, I am convinced that animal testing is necessary,
and that it will continue to benefit humans in new and wonderful ways.
