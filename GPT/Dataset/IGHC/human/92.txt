Youth drug abuse is a serious problem nowadays in many cultures. Not only is illegal drug
use on the rise, but children as young as 10 years old are experimenting with alcohol and
tobacco. The reasons for this behaviour are unclear, but certain sociologists blame the
examples set by their elders.
Parents who drink and smoke to excess are, in effect, telling their children that it is
acceptable to abuse their bodies with drugs. Consequently, children may have a similar
view towards illegal drugs, even if their parents are against their use. In addition, drug use
shown on television and in films can only confuse children who are also taught at school
that drug abuse is wrong.
The pressure on young people to perform well at school in order to compete for jobs is a
possible cause of the problem. Many believe they cannot live up to their parents'
expectations, and feel a sense of hopelessness. Also, the widespread availability of drugs
means teenagers are faced with the temptation to experiment. Drugs are used as a
means of expressing dissatisfaction with the pressures they face in society.
The effects of drug abuse are well known. Many young people's talents are wasted, and
addiction to hard drugs can cost a user his or her life. Furthermore, those who drink and
drive may be involved in fatal road accidents. The cost to society is great, and enormous
amounts of money are spent on convicting drug dealers and on education programmes.
To conclude, I recommend that the only sensible way to solve this problem is to educate
young people about the dangers of drug use, and to take steps to reduce the pressure of
competition placed upon them.
