Many people have to work under somebody's supervision. 
In most cases an employee does not choose his or her boss, unless a supervisor is elected. 
In the following paragraphs I will list the most important qualities of my "ideal boss".
First of all, he must be impartial. I believe that it is very important to make a technical
decision, think about somebody's promotion, etc. impartially. For instance, my friend is a
supervisor on a dairy mill. It is his family's business so a lot of his relatives work there. But
he never promotes someone because he or she is his family. I think it is a good quality for
a boss.
Second of all, my "ideal boss" must be honest, patient and attentive. He should pay
attention to people's feelings, encourage them by increasing their salary, listen to their
suggestions about improving labor conditions and productivity. For instance, if he does
not satisfied with the result he should understand the origin of the problem and explain
people how to fix it. In addition, he must know how to solve conflicts that can arise
between employees.
Another important quality of a boss is the ability to choose the right decisions and to learn
on somebody's mistakes.
Finally, I think a good boss must value his or her employees because the profit directly
depends on the people who work there.
In conclusion, I think a good boss should be able to make his people enjoy the work they
are doing and encourage their diligence.
