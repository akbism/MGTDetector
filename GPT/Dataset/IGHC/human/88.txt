People may choose to keep their old traditions from their native country or to accept new
ones. Keeping the old customs will help one to overcome the cultural shock and the
change of the environment. From the other side, accepting the new traditions will help one
to adapt and make new friends with residents. In this essay I will give different reasons
why people decide to follow the customs of the new country or to keep their own customs.
If one is from the country with strong and old traditions, I think it will be rather difficult for
him to adapt to the new customs and moreover to reject his own. That is why some
people from the same country try to live together and to create their own community
where the old traditions are kept. They can not break the customs that were created by
their ancestors. For example, some nations are restricted in certain kinds of food by their
traditions. So, they do not go to the restaurants unless their traditional food is served
there. Some nations according to their customs have to wear certain types of cloth
because their religion tells them to do so.
From the other side, if one is from the country with traditions similar to ones of the new
country it will be easy for him to adopt and to follow the customs of the new place. He will
not feel much difference. Probably, the most difficult part of his relocation will be to
accustom to the new climate.
I think that people of the new country are friendlier when they see that foreigner follows
their customs. I belief that traditions of every country deserve respect, especially, when
one lives there. In summary, I think that every country has its own beauty and if one
wants to find out more about it he will love it.
