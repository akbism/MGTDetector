The advanced `Mind machines' so called `the Computers' are no doubt the best products
of latest technology. One cannot imagine the advancement of life and Sciences without
these machines.
But like other achievements; they have their own good and bad effects as seen with
experience and passage of time. In my opinion they are good if used for educational and
beneficial uses for health and living etc.
Basically twentieth century had been famous for its latest Computer techniques and their
application on our lives. Datas shown on Computers help us to assess how much
education is conducted through this media. The assessment ways as well as
examinations are improved. Moreover personal skills of reading and writing are far more
improved through Computers.
Moreover Science and technology progressed immensely with computers. Researchers
like cloning and transplants are only possible with modern computerized skills.
Good question comes to ones mind ... where will this Computer would take us next??
Certainly no one knows! We might explore new planners. May be we will buy houses on
Moon, Mars or Jupitor. Or we might loose our own identity. One cannot forget the end of
2000 millennium when everybody was in chaos to think what will happen if the computers
crash? The aeroplanes were going to crash and the trains would colloid. That Show we
are forced to think that one should not be dependent on these machine after all we are
humans. We are here to command computers not them to order us.
