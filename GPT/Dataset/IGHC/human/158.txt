It is generally accepted that we all need leisure time to recover from the stresses of work
and everyday life.
Personally, I prefer to be active during this time, as I think this suits me better. However,
what we do with our leisure time is up to us and no one can say that any particular activity
is the best.
Some people relax by watching movies, reading or surfing the internet. People who have
physically demanding jobs may choose these types of activities. If you are a nurse or
builder, you may feel that you don't want to do a five-kilometre run after work, because
you are already physically tired.
Other people do very sedentary jobs. Computer analysts, for example, may spend all day
sitting in front of a computer screen. At the end of the working day, they may be keen to
stretch their limbs and improve their health by swimming or going to the gym.
Another factor that influences our choice of leisure pursuit is where we work. People who
work indoors often prefer outdoor hobbies, whereas for people who work outdoors, the
reverse may be true. I am a student myself and this involves a lot of sitting in lectures, so I
need to get out into the fresh air afterwards.
In any situation, the important thing is that people need to stay healthy by choosing what
is best for them. The only wrong way to spend free time, in my view, is to have a
sedentary job and then go home and watch television.
