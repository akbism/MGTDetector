I live in a small community. From my everyday experience and observation I can say that
the idea about building a new theatre in my neighborhood has some advantages as well
as disadvantages. In this essay I will first focus on the reasons why I support this idea and
then move on to analyzing why I oppose it.
First of all, I like movies and my husband and I sometimes go to the movie theatre to
watch premieres. Unfortunately, it is time-consuming for us. We have to drive about 50
minutes to the nearest movies theatre. So, the idea of having a movie theatre in our
neighborhood seems very attractive. It would save us an hour just to get there and
another hour to get back home. Another important aspect of it is that in this case we will
be able to get to the movie theatre by foot. I must to confess that we always have parking
troubles in the parking space near the movie theatre.
Second of all, new movie theatre is a very good place for students who want to earn some
money. My husband and I live near a student community, so I think it would be a great
news for them. In addition to this practical benefit students will be able to watch all movies
free of charge. I suppose it is a great way to save some money.
Finally, there are usually many restaurants and entertaining centers around a movie
theatre. There people can have dinner or play game machines.
In contrast, I think that the building of a new movie theatre will destroy the silence and
beauty of out community. Such entertaining centers are often noisy. Moreover, traffic jams
will probably be the result of it.
In conclusion, I think that if the question was about building a new movie theatre in the
next neighborhood I would completely agree.
