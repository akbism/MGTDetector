Studying a language in a country where it is widely spoken has many advantages. It is,
therefore, a good idea to study English in a country such as Britain. However, I believe it
is not the only way to learn the language.
In the first place, most students in non-English-speaking countries learn English at
secondary school, and sometimes at university nowadays. Although their spoken English
is not usually of a very high standard, their knowledge of grammar is often quite
advanced. This is certainly useful when students come to an English-speaking country to
perfect the language.
Secondly, studying the basics of English at secondary school is less stressful than
learning the language while overseas. This is because students living at home do not
have to worry about problems such as finding accommodation, paying for their study and
living costs, and trying to survive in a foreign country where day to day living causes much
stress.
However, there are obvious advantages of learning English in Britain. Every day there are
opportunities to practise listening to and speaking with British people. Also, students can
experience the culture firsthand, which is a great help when trying to understand the
language. This is especially true if they choose to live with a British family, as exchange
students for example. Furthermore, if students attend a language school full-time, the
teachers will be native speakers. In this case, not only will students' speaking and
listening skills improve, but attention can be given to developing reading and writing skills
as well.
In general, even though it is preferable to study English in an English-speaking country, a
reasonable level of English can be achieved in one's own country, if a student is gifted
and dedicated to study.
