Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial
assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and
personality is a much debatable issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for
children for several reasons.
It is said that children learn valuable experience in the work place. This may be true.
However, I would argue that children are mainly employed for jobs that require manual
work and are low paid. The recent statistic reveals the common tasks that children are
assigned are washing dishes, cleaning floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile,
this kind of jobs actually do not provide children with necessary and useful skills so that
they can apply in their future carrer.
This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child work argues that it is an effective
method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to
them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means
that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is
yet to come. They may become so occupied with the benefits ahead of them like small
salary and leave school.
Finally, supporters said that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will
understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have a compassionate view with
their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on
children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is
appropriate to spend on luxury things by their own money, which could be recovered later.
In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child to work,
otherwise it would have a negative consequences on their futures.
