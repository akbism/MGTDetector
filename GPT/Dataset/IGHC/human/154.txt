I think wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth among poorer nations. But
their helping should only stop at providing such things as food and education because of
three following reasons.
Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore,
we can not look at, hear of, and talk about people who lack food, education, etc… without
compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth among poorer nations is not only a good deed
but also a task itself.
Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are very very poor. Famine, diseases, crime
and illiteracy are killing their citizens. In the contrary, a lot of nations in Europe and
America are too rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase
dramatically. Poor countries will become more and more poorer while rich countries will
become more and more richer. As a result, poorest countries will be slaves of richest
countries. So, sharing wealth is an useful way to prevent people from that bad future.
Thirdly, although sharing wealth among poorer nations is very necessary but this helping
should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor
nations may depend on aid. They won’t have enthusiasm to build their countries by
themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere
deeply in poor nations’ governments. This can’t be considered humane action and should
be prevented.
In my opinion, sharing wealth among poorer nations has both bad side and good side.
What we have to do is avoiding its bad side and practicing its good side.
This is an excellent essay, your arguments are convincing and very well presented.
There are only a few minor mistakes, read and consider the comments. Very well
done!'
