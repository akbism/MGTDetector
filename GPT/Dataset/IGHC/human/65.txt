There have been big changes in the attitudes of most parents over the last few years.
Very few parents would agree with using force regularly as a way of dealing with
discipline problems in their children. Physical punishment is banned in schools in most
countries, and in many countries, there are moves to ban all corporal punishment of
children even in the home. However, many parents still believe that they have a right to
use some physical punishment to deal with certain misbehaviors at certain ages. This
essay will ask if some physical punishment is acceptable today, and will ask how parents
can know what the limits are.
It is easy to find reasons to allow some physical punishment. One issue is that many
parents find it very difficult to abandon physical punishment completely. Parents argue
that this was the way they were brought up themselves and that it didn’t do any harm to
them. They believe that for the child’s sake that they have the right to discipline the child
in any way they see fit, including using corporal punishment. A second point is that
corporal punishment can be quick and effective: there is not much point reasoning with a
screaming child in the supermarket. Finally, most parents are reasonable and fair, and
very very few would ever consider hurting their children by using unnecessary physical
force.
There are several reasons however why we should stop using physical punishment even
in the home. One point is that most parents are not trained to deal with misbehaving
children. They do not have enough resources or choices to handle the situation. As a
result, they immediately react by smacking or hitting the child, even if there are other
solutions to the problem. Another point is that unless people are challenged or forced to
change their beliefs they may keep following negative habits. An example is seatbelt use now most people wear seat belts without thinking, whereas years ago the idea of using
safety belts was strange to most people. In the same way, banning physical punishment
in the home will allow people to change their habits and break a cycle of violence.
However, the most obvious reason for banning all physical punishment of children is to
prevent child abuse. If all parents are allowed to hit their children in the name of discipline,
some parents will go too far and will inflict severe emotional and physical damage on their
children. It may only be a smll minority of parents, but we need to protect all our children.
In conclusion, parents have to change some of their beliefs and ideas about how children
should be raised. It is possible to avoid the use of physical force in the home, and doing
so will help us move closer to dream of removing violence from our society.
