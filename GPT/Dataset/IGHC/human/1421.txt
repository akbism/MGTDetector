Art is a basic human need. Governments have a responsibility to spend money on art for
their citizens. (Shorter version: 260 words)
Many people's lives are richer because of art - music, paintings, calligraphy, pictures,
sculpture, poems and dance. However, some people feel that governments should be
spending money on housing, medical care, or defence, instead of on art. This essay will
discuss whether governments should or should not spend money on the arts.
There are several reasons why governments should not finance artists. First of all,
artists should have to follow the same rules as the rest of the market. If there is a demand
for their music or sculpture, then they will be rich. Secondly, politicians generally do not
have good taste. They will waste public money on popular art or on their own preferences.
But the main reason why governments should minimize spending on the art world
is that there are more important areas like housing, roads, hospitals, and factories which
need the money first.
However, it would be wrong to say that governments should not spend any money at
all on art. Everybody needs some beauty in their life, but not everyone can afford a
Picasso or a piece of music. Governments should provide money for museums or concert
halls for everyone. Another point is that art allows people to express themselves and
this is good for society, culture and thought. Thirdly, artists can be good for the economy
by producing music, films, and attracting tourists.
All in all, governments should prioritize their spending carefully, but they should also
allocate some of their budget for art. It is part of their duty to society and to future
generations.
