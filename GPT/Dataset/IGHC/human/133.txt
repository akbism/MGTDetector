In modern society, especially in big cities, undoubtedly hard work has become a very
important feature of ordinary people’s everyday life. It seems that many people are under
the impression that their work is becoming more pressing and urgent, and thus they
sacrifice more and more leisure time.
In the first place, with the rapid development of science and technology, work today is
more demanding than it used to be. For example, college graduates nowadays have to
master English, computer science and driving skills before they can find decent jobs.
People have to spend more time acquiring new techniques and skills. And their spare
time tends to be fully occupied, not with leisure pursuit, but with work-related pursuits.
In the second place, competition is becoming more intense. Many people feel anxious
that they may be “laid-off” if they can’t work as hard as others. And they also feel at a
disadvantage before new graduates. Therefore, it is understandable that people keep
themselves involved in intensely hard work in order to preserve their positions.
In my opinion, the worst aspect of this phenomenon is that the huge pressure of work will
gradually affect people’s mental health. Excessively hard work means that people can
never get rid of the fatigue of their work, even in their leisure time. This means that they
can not enjoy a normal life.
In a word, in modern society overwork is stealing our leisure time. however, I believe this
problem will be settled eventually with the development of science and technology.
