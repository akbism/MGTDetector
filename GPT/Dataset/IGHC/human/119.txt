For over fifty years, a number of nations have been involved in the exploration of outer
space. This research has been very costly, of course. Has this money been well-spent or
wasted?
Some people believe that all or most space research should be eliminated because of its
incredible expense, not only in terms of money, but also in terms of scientific and human
resources. These people point out the fact that it cost billions of dollars to send astronauts
to the moon, but all they brought back were some worthless rocks. These people say that
the money and effort now being wasted in outer space could be spent for homeless
people, improving the education system, saving the environment, and finding cures for
diseases.
However, other people believe that space research has provided many benefits to
mankind. They point out that hundreds of useful products, from personal computers to
heart pacemakers to freeze-dried foods, are the direct or indirect results of space
research. They say that weather and communication satellites, which are also products of
space programs, have benefited people all over the globe. In addition to these practical
benefits, supporters of the space program point to the scientific knowledge that has been
acquired about the sun, the moon, the planets and even our own earth as a result of
space research.
I agree with those people who support space research and want it to continue. Space
research, as shown, has already brought many benefits to humanity. Perhaps it will bring
even more benefits in the future, ones that we can not even imagine now. Moreover, just
as individual people need challenges to make their lives more interesting, I believe the
human race itself needs a challenge, and I think that the peaceful exploration of outer
space provides just such a challenge.
