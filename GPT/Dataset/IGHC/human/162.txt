Today the way we consider human psychology and mental development is heavily
influenced by the genetic sciences. We now understand the importance of inherited
characteristics more than over before. Yet we are still unable to decide whether an
individual’s personality and development are more influenced by genetic factors (nature)
or by the environment (nurture).
Research, relating to identical twins, has highlighted how significant inherited
characteristics can be for an individual's life. But whether these characteristics are able to
develop within the personality of an individual surely depends on whether the
circumstances allow such a development. It seems that the experiences we have in life
are so unpredictable and so powerful, that they can boost or over-ride other influences,
and there seems to be plenty of research findings to confirm this.
My own view is that there is no one major influence in a person's life. Instead, the traits
we inherit from our parents and the situation and experiences that we encounter in life are
constantly interacting. It is the interaction of the two that shapes a person's personality
and dictates how that personality develops. If this were not true, we would be able to
predict the behavior and character of a person from the moment they were born.
In conclusion, I do not think that either nature or nurture is the major influence on a
person, but that both have powerful effects. How these factors interact is still unknown
today and they remain largely unpredictable in a person’s life.
