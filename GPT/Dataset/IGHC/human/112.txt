It’s widely believed in today’s materialistic world that the latest innovative fashion trends
hold great significance. On the other hand, such trends are believed to be set only in the
pursuit of profits for large designer companies. It seems that in recent times, people are
now changing their minds in regards to wearing clothes for comfort and as a personal
choice. Personally I agree that we should pay more attention to individuality and comfort
in the way we dress.
Firstly, fashion designs exist as a form of creative artistic expression of the designer.
Although this may be true, undoubtedly such designs take away individuality once a trend
is set in place. By this I mean that there is nothing unique about wearing what everybody
else does. More specifically, if everyone sports the latest colour and design in summer
skirts, do we not look the same?
Secondly, It is possible that fashion trends can look extremely stylish to the general
public. However, it can be argued that the main purpose of wearing clothes is for more
functional reasons. This is primarily due to the fact that clothes were traditionally worn to
protect people from climatic conditions. For instance, clothes are still worn basically to
keep people warm and dry in winter and cool in summer.
Finally, fashion certainly gives us a sense of confidence and pride in our appearance.
While this is certainly a good point, it also means that following such changeable trends
proves to be expensive. For example, purchasing every latest season’s fashion item will
of course blow the budget of many young people.
In conclusion, there are various arguments to support the dismissal of fashion trends,
consisting of not conforming, comfort and price, which I strongly agree with.
