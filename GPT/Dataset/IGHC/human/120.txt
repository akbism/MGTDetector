Holidays are important because they provide a break from our normal daily routine and
from the world of work. Traditionally, holidays have been seen as a time for relaxation and
as an opportunity to visit another country in order to find out about its geography and
customs. Nowadays, however, it seems that other types of holiday are becoming popular.
Some people want their holiday to be a kind of adventure, and find this more exciting than
going to the beach or visiting museums. On an adventure holiday, you may stay in quite
basic accommodation, rather than a luxurious hotel. Activities may involve things such as
bush walking or cycling, or may form part of an aid project designed to help communities
in remote areas. Holidays such as these are popular with people of all ages and can often
help to promote tourism in rural environments.
The increasing popularity of dangerous sports has also boosted the number of adventure
holidays; for example, water sports, mountain climbing or paragliding. These holidays are
more popular with the younger generation, as they can be both physically and mentally
demanding. Participants are often seeking the sort of thrills that they cannot get in
ordinary life.
There is now greater awareness of the damaging effects of mass tourism and this may be
one reason for the changing nature of holidays. This can only be a good thing. But
perhaps people are also discovering that it is just as refreshing to take an active holiday,
as it is to lie on a beach - though that is still a question of personal preference.
