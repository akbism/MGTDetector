Today, education has become a priority for many parents seeking to secure a good future
for their children in this rapidly changing world. They believe that if their children apply
themselves and work hard at school, then they will increase their opportunities for going
to higher education and eventually getting a good job. Of course they are right, and as
access to the best education and best jobs is becoming more competitive, then it is true
that children have to make the best of their study time when they are young.
However, the parents who do not allow their children sufficient free time for leisure
activities outside school hours, are misguided. Such activities are far from being a waste
of time for the children simply because they are not academic. It is important to remember
that children need to develop skills other than intellectual ones, and the best way to do
this is through activities such as sports, games and playing with other kids. If they cannot
play make-believe games, how can they develop their imagination? How can they learn
physical co-ordination or learn important social lessons about winning and losing if they
do not practise any sports? Many children form strong, personal relationships with the
friends they play with, and without the opportunity to do this, they could grow up
emotionally immature or unformed.
Finally, I think it is also important to remember that children need to relax as well as work.
If everything they do must have some educational or academic relevance, then they will
soon get tired of studying altogether, which is the last thing parents would want.
