"Do as I say, not as I do." This is what society tells us when it punishes murderers with the
death penalty. Society tells us that murder is wrong, and in our legal system, murder is
against the law. Yet we still see our society kill murderers, and thus we are committing
murder ourselves. For this reason, the death penalty should end, and instead murderers
should be punished with life in prison.
Society needs to show a positive model of how our lives should be and how people
should act. We should always strive to improve our situation, to be at peace and in
harmony with others. However, when we kill murderers, we are not working to improve
our society. Instead, we are stooping to the criminals' level.
It makes me think about the revenge that came when playing games with my brothers.
When we were kids/children, my brother would take my toys, so I would hit him and take
my toys back. Then he would hit me harder and take the toys again. Thinking of the death
penalty, I imagine a murderer kills someone. Society takes revenge by killing the
murderer. This leaves behind the murderer's family and friends, who have tremendous
anger inside of them, which they may release onto society. The cycle of killing goes on
and on.
Society should not condemn people who are taking the same action that society is taking.
Society tells us not to kill, and yet society kills when it exercises the death penalty.
Because of this contradiction, we should end the death penalty and instead punish
murderers by sentencing them to life in prison.
