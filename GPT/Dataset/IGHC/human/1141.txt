Over the last half century the pace of change in the life of human beings has increased
beyond our wildest expectations. This has been driven by technological and scientific
breakthroughs that are changing the whole way we view the world on an almost daily
basis. This means that change is not always a personal option, but an inescapable fact of
life, and we need to constantly adapt to keep pace with it.
Those people who believe they have achieved some security by doing the same, familiar
things are living in denial. Even when people believe they are resisting change
themselves, they cannot stop the world around them from changing. Sooner or later they
will find that the familiar jobs no longer exist, or that the ‘safe’ patterns of behaviour are
no longer appropriate.
However, reaching the conclusion that change is inevitable is not the same as assuming
that ‘change is always for the better’. Unfortunately, it is not always the case that new
things are promoted because they have good impacts for the majority of people. A lot of
innovations are made with the aim of making money for a few. This is because it is the
rich and powerful people in our society who are able to impose changes (such as in
working conditions or property developments) that are in their own interests.
In conclusion, I would say that change can be stimulating and energising for individuals
when they pursue it themselves, but that all change, including that which is imposed on
people, does not necessarily have good outcomes.
