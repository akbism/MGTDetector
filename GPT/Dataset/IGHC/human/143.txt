Security cameras have become ubiquitous in many countries. Whereas before they
appeared only in banks and at high-security areas, they are now entering public places
such as malls, streets, stadiums and transport. Many people feel this affects their privacy.
This essay will examine whether the advantages of these cameras outweigh their
negative impact.
Surveillance cameras have several benefits. An obvious benefit is that the police can
catch criminals in the act, thus reducing crime. This will make the streets safer for ordinary
people. A more important point is that criminals, particularly young offenders or petty
criminals will be deterred. They will not be tempted to carry out crimes, and thus society
will be a lot safer. Cameras are also cost-effective and unobtrusive. Authorities do not
need to spend large amounts of money on police.
However, security cameras are far from being a perfect solution. The biggest objection
concerns privacy. Many people feel that they should be free to travel or move around a
shop, mall, street or country without being photographed or recorded. They feel that being
watched constantly is like being in a jail, and that ordinary people are losing their freedom
because of these devices. Another point is that although the police say that only criminals
have something to fear from the cameras, many people do not trust governments with too
much information. Corrupt authorities could use information in the wrong way or twist it to
victimize some groups. Thirdly, cameras and computers can make mistakes.
In conclusion, although there are definite advantages to using surveillance devices such
as cameras, we need to balance the need for security with respect for the individual's
privacy and freedom. If we do not trust the members of society, a situation like George
Orwell's "1984" could be the result.
