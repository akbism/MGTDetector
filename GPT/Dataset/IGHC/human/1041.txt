I am from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I believe that building a large factory near my
community has advantages as well as disadvantages. In the following paragraphs I will
list basic benefits and losses that will be brought by a new factory.
For several reasons, I think that a new factory will not be a good addition to my
neighborhood. First of all, factories often bring pollution. They are prone to contaminating
the local air and water. Second of all, factories make noise. Another important aspect of
building a new factory near by is that it will make the local traffic heavy. As a result of this,
the amount of traffic congestions will increase, as well as contamination of the air. So, all
these obviously will not make one's life happier and healthier in my community.
From the other side, I believe that a new factory will bring some advantages to my
community. First of all, it will bring new job opportunities. Many specialists will be required
to work there. Second of all, I think many local community facilities will have to be
renovated to obtain reliable supply of water and electricity. So, some old pipes may be
changed. Another important benefit of this is that the local roads in order to manage the
increasing traffic will be rebuilt and widened.
However, I do not think that listed above benefits are worth all these troubles including
water contamination and the constant pollution of air. From my point of view all factories
must be built far from the people communities because they can be really harmful for
people's health.
