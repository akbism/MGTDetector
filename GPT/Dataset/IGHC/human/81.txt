Before talking about the essential role of death penalty, you have to think about the
meaning, and the purpose, of any kind of punishment. If you consider that the purpose is
to prevent the guilty from being nasty again, you can be seduced by an argumentation in
favour of the suppression of capital punishment. But you have to think about another
aspect of the problem: a punishment is also useful to impress people, to make them fear
the law. In fact, let's take the example of a young misfit, which has grown in a violent
atmosphere, influenced by older delinquents, etc ... He lives in the streets, he's got no aim
but to survive. This is the kind of person who could possibly kill someone for money, or
even for fun ... Why would he fear prison? Life would be easier for him there. In addition,
in many cases, when you behave normally, you can benefit from penalty reductions. This
young misfit needs to be impressed, he needs to know that the law is a frontier. When you
cross it, you can lose your life. That is why capital punishment helps keeping a distance
between robbery and murder. If you abolish it, you suppress the difference between these
two types of crime, which are completely different.
But there is also a limit to define: even if death penalty is unavoidable, it would be a crime
to apply it to inadequate cases. If there is no premeditation or past facts which can justify
such a punishment, it is far too strict to apply death penalty. That is why the lawmakers
have to establish precisely the context in which capital punishment car be pronounced.
That is the price to pay to limit violence without using excessive violence.
Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must
acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty but others are totally in
favour. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th
century, tolerance and respect for life are important values. Moreover, we can affirm that
all the Europe remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point,
life respect is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.
Those who are in favour of capital punishment are particularly in radical countries. It is not
surprising to watch some barbarian behaviours in Islamic countries like public stoning to
death. The population is invited to participate on the trial and in the final sentence - deathitself. However, this is not just an image of third world countries. Actually, USA is where this kind of punishment has its higher rates. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top,
supporting this measure against crime, especially those related with serial killers and
those involving children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is
foreseen that this penalty will continue into a future next.
Maybe this is not a clear question. As we can see there are several values here and of
course cultural behaviours. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and
even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show those divisions. The
solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. It will
be better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that life sentence could be
a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate
psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some
murderers and other perverted people will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital
punishment is a soft release.
