I am from Russia. From my opinion the most beneficial discovery for people in our country
has been the discovery of the outer space. Russia is the first country that launched a
spacecraft with a man on the board into the space. This event was a big step towards the
new discoveries and brought many benefits not only for people in my country. Bellow I will
give my reasons to support my answer.
First of all, all humankind made a huge step towards the mystery of our creation.
Scientists had the opportunity to do the new research and experiments. Many new
discoveries were made on the boards of the spacecrafts in the outer space. People from
all over the world watched these events. Many books with real colorful photos were
written about the beginning of the space exploration. Nowadays we have a big station
called "Mir" in the outer space created on the base of collaboration USA and Russia.
Many people work there doing amazing experiments.
Second of all, the world became "smaller". People learnt how to exchange information
very quickly by use of satellites. Television is broad-casted all over the world by use of
satellites. Here in Houston I can watch Russian programs. People got the opportunity to
exchange news very quickly.
To sum up, I believe that space exploration will bring much more benefits in the future and
someday we will learn what is beyond our current galaxy.
