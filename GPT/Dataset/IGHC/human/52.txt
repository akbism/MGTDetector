Nobody can say with confidence that children should be taught at home or at any
children's institutions. There are many different children and every one demand of
education suitable only for him.
But for most of children the best way of learning the life is being in the children's
institutions. Nobody would argue that contacts between children of the same age are very
important for bringing your child up. Such a contact is very important for playing,
entertaining and learning living with other people. The harmonious living with other
people, to my mind, is the first task for any man. Lack of this harmony sets problems and
troubles.
The children need space to run and make noise, to jump and cry. Do you or your
neighbours allow these actions for your child? If you live in town, it is difficult to find a safe
place to play. Kindergartens give such a possibility. They give space, a lot of toys and
constructions for physical exercises. So, if you have bad living conditions, the
kindergarten is the best way for you. But if you have a large family with many children and
enough space, you may keep your child at home. You should be sure that the child feels,
dressed and comfortable. His brothers and sisters give him necessary contacts. It's
noticed long ago that children in big families are much more easy-tempered and calm.
They are located in more harmonic world than others.
Sometimes differences in age put troubles in contacts between children in large families.
Then it is better for child to be sent to the kindergarten (school). But if quarrels don't last
for a long time, everything is all right. In general, quarrels develop ability to cooperate with
people. They develop a personal initiative and force setting the balance. In such a way
the child gets lessons of life. Addly, the quarrels often take place in kindergartens and
schools and we shouldn't fear it.
Side by side with quarrels parents often are afraid of colds which happen in kindergartens
more frequently. Parents prefer keeping the child at home. But for a healthy child odd cold
(if illness occurs, it goes its normal course) can't make big harm to the child. And if the
child is adaptable to the conditions of public places earlier it would be better for him in
future.
In general, I am a follower of the theory of keeping children in adapted places such as
good kindergartens. But keeping children in such a place can't replace family and home.
Only together they make harmonic and beautiful union.
