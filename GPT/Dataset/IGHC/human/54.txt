I can not completely agree with the statement that classmates are a more important
influence than parents on a child's success in school. In this essay I will first focus on the
reasons why I agree with this statement and then list a few points why from my opinion in
some cases is not true.
From the one side, classmates have a significant influence on child's behavior and his or
her success in school. First of all, children spend much time at school. Classmates have
many things in common such as age, interests, homework and classes after all. So, they
discuss their impressions about a new teacher, solve problems together, learn their
homework, gain new knowledge and experience and even make their own discoveries.
Sharing all these makes them closer. Some of them become friends and they spend afterschool time together. In addition friends tend to copy each other's habits and manners.
For instance, my little sister became friends with the girl who did not have good grades at
school at that time. It does not mean she could not have better grades; she just had many
friends who did not care about their grades. So, when they started to spend their time
together and share their interests, girl's grades improved. They did their homework
together, shared their dreams and exciting moments. From this point I must agree that
classmates can change childâ€™s attitude towards school.
From the other side, parents have a great influence on children' success in school too.
For example if parents show an interest in their child's progress and talk to him or her
about the importance of learning I think their child will listen to them and do his or her
best.
Personally, I believe that relationships between parents and a child play an essential role
in child's success in school. If these relationships are close and wholehearted I am sure
that parents should not be afraid of bad influence from the outside.
