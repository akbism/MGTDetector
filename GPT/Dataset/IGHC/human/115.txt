Every four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the
Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to
make their country proud of them. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in
easing international tensions in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control
the world's economy and other governments were fighting over land.
The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can
bring nations together, at least temporarily. From ancient History, when Greeks and
Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent
international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their
differences, compete pacifically and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover,
these popular events have called the world's attention to the terrible consequences of
wars; thus some leaders have tried to accept agreements to end their dispute and live
peacefully.
Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which
live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack
of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense
embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football
World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world,
provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their
problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national
colors, use wear the Brazilian team shirt and buy national flags. Moreover, the
competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games
and celebrate peacefully.
In conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international
tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as History has shown.
