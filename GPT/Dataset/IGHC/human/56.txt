People learn through their entire lives. Curiosity was always the basic characteristic of a
human being. We always want to break limits and learn more. At this point some people
think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and spend most
of their time on school studies. This will help them to succeed in the future. However, for
several reasons, which I will explain bellow, I think that children should not study at a very
early age.
Of cause, children who begin to study at a very early age have more chances to succeed
in the future. They gain more knowledge and experience which are priceless and
valuable. In addition, studying more now they will give them the opportunity to perfect
their knowledge in the future and become better professionals.
However, I think that every child must have his or her childhood. Children should learn
through playing and communication with their friends and parents. I think that such basic
qualities as kindness, self-confidence and just a good sense of humor can not be gained
from studying. Children should more time spend with their family, playing and learning
with their parents. Imagine that a child instead of playing with his friends does his
homework and feel exhausted and tired. Another important aspect of this is that children
at their early ages need more exercise because at this age the development of their body
is a very essential aspect. Children first of all must be healthy.
To sum up, I think that children should have their careless childhood with no
responsibilities. Moreover, I am sure that playing helps them develop not only their bones
and muscles but their ability to make decisions, analyze things, make conclusions, which
is very good for their future.
