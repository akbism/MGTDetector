These days with increasing urban populations, there are major problems with congestion
and not only the price, but also availability of accommodation in large cities of the world. It
seems that one possible solution could be to relocate large companies and factories as
well as their respective employees out of these urban areas and into more rural ones. In
my opinion, I strongly agree that this would have a desired effect in making cities more
livable.
To begin with, the traffic problem in cities doesn’t only exist from commuting employees,
but also the general public travelling around the city. While this may be a fact, if the
number of worker’s vehicles is reduced on city streets, a large percentage of traffic will
obviously decline in rush hours. For example, peak hour traffic is undoubtedly made up
largely of staff from companies going to and from home.
Secondly, in regards to housing problems, populations will always continue to grow in
cities and therefore inadvertently decrease the number of cheap and available
apartments. This is certainly obvious, however, a large proportion of these apartments are
occupied by employees from large firms and their families. If this workforce is relocated to
housing estates in the country, city apartment blocks will fall in price and certainly
increase in availability.
In conclusion, by relocating workers to rural areas to work and reside, heavy traffic
conditions and lack of adequate accommodation in city centres will obviously change for
the better. As far as I’m concerned, I agree that the government should enforce such a
law in order to increase our standard of living in our hectic city life.
