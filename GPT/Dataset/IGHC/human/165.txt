If I could change one thing about my hometown, I think it would be the fact that there’s no
sense of community here. People don’t feel connected, they don’t look out for each other,
and they don’t get to know their neighbors.
People come and go a lot here. They change jobs frequently and move on. This means
that they don’t put down roots in the community. They don’t join community organizations
and they’re not willing to get involved in trying to improve the quality of life. If someone
has a petition to put in a new street light, she has a very hard time getting a lot of people
to sign. They don’t feel it has anything to do with them. They don’t get involved in
improving the schools because they don’t think the quality of education is important to
their lives. They don’t see the connection between themselves and the rest of their
community.
People don’t try to support others around them. They don’t keep a friendly eye on their
children, or check in on older folks if they don’t see them for a few days. They’re not
aware when people around them may be going through a hard time. For example, they
may not know if a neighbor loses a loved one. There’s not a lot of community support for
individuals.
Neighbors don’t get to know each other. Again, this is because people come and go
within a few years. So when neighbors go on vacation, no one is keeping an eye on their
house. No one is making sure nothing suspicious is going on there, like lights in the
middle of the night. When neighbors’ children are cutting across someone’s lawn on their
bikes, there’s no friendly way of casually mentioning the problem. People immediately act
as if it’s a major property disagreement.
My hometown is a nice place to live in many ways, but it would be much nice if we had
that sense of community.
