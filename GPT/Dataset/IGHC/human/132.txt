The salaries of many singers, dancers and sports people have increased out of all
proportion in recent years, while in places like Sudan people are starving to death. I do
not beleive that anyone should be able to earn such enormous salaries whan so many
people in the world are living in poverty.
One af the factors which should affect what a person can earn ought to be the benefit of
person's work to society. It is unreasonable for a famous singer to be able to earn far
more from an evening's entertainment than, for instance, a medical scientist who
develops a new drug which produces a treatment for a common disease. The pop star
certainly has a value in society, but the value in no way exceeds, or even matches, the
value gained from a successful medication.
Secondly. work done should be paid according to the amount of effort and skill that goes
into it. Nobody would deny that a famous person works hard and is skillful, yet such
people do not work any harder than thousand of other workers who have no claim to
fame. Yet market force are such that these superstarts can obtain millions of dolor while
other unknown people sometimes earn less than they need to survive.
Finally, it should be possible for governments to work together to ensure that the amount
of money in circulation should be more more equally and fairly distributed. This seems
only fair given that there are so many suffering.
To conclude, it is clear that world poverty is a serious problem and yet the problem could
be eased if governments and compenies gave more thought to paying salaries on a more
equitable basis and if they started to contribute more money to those in need.
