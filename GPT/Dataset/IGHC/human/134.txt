In the modern workplace there is no longer the attitude that ‘a job is for life’. Nowadays,
many people take the option to change jobs, while others prefer not to. In my essay, I will
explore the good and bad points of the above attitudes.
One of the main benefits of staying in one job is security. Changing employer often means
a period of instability, where one may have to think about moving house, or temporarily
losing a steady source of income. Staying in one job means these problems are avoided.
Another benefit of not changing occupation is that one is able to gain a lot of experience
and expertise in his specific profession, thus enhancing job security. One’s company may
recognize their loyalty and reward their service. On the other hand, those who often
change jobs may be seen as unreliable, lacking in experience and employers might be
reluctant to hire and invest training in them.
However, there are arguments in favour of changing job frequently. One is that a worker
improves his employability. Working in several different jobs often means that the
individual has more skills. Such people are seen as more dynamic and versatile.
Another benefit of changing jobs frequently is that one never gets stuck in a rut. From my
own experience, I got bored when I spent too long in a job. Following this, the quality of
my work would suffer. I also believe that employers generally don’t tend to greatly reward
loyalty or commitment. Increased wages and promotion are often easier to attain by
changing jobs.
Overall, it can be said that the disadvantages of changing jobs are the advantages of
staying put, and vice versa... In my opinion, I feel that changing jobs every once in a while
is of more benefit.
