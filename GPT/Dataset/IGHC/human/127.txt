Form my everyday experience and observation I think that all people who succeeded in
life had to work hard and gain more knowledge and experience in order to reach their
goals. From the other hand, people who all their life do things they already do well and do
not improve their knowledge do not move forward. I base my statement on the following
points.
First of all, people who want to succeed must constantly improve their knowledge and
gain more experience. Moreover, they must be the best at their profession. So, they need
to try new things, take risks sometimes and work hard.
Second of all, it is impossible to live without trying new things. Imagine one wants to learn
how to drive. He will never be able to do it without learning new things such as driving rules. 
Personally, I think that it is very interesting to learn new, to gain more experience, to make
new goals and reach them. Life is too short to stay on one place. People need changes
because they make our lives more beautiful and exiting. We find out new things, learn
new things and dream to know other things. People need challenges because while
overcoming obstacles we make new discoveries, become stronger, perfect ourselves and
move forward.
To sum up, I believe that people's aspiration for learning new things is the main reason
the way we live now. People make many discoveries and inventions that make our lives
easier, happier and longer.
