With the advent of globalization, a common language to facilitate trade and
communication seems inevitable. Some oppose the development of a single language on
the grounds that it may lead to cultural erosion and a loss of local linguistic knowledge.
Yet, I am of the opinion that it is possible to use an official international language and still
retain one’s own language and culture.
Firstly, many countries already use an official language or languages. For example, in
India there are two official languages: Hindi and English. In a country such as India where
there are innumerable languages spoken, there is a need for official languages to ensure
communication between different sections of the population and the different states. In
China, where different dialects are spoken, Mandarin, the official language, enables
people from different provinces to comprehend each other.
Secondly, in an age of rampant globalization there is no doubt that an international
language is inevitability. How is an African businessman going to conduct business in
China when there are such differences between languages? In this sense, not only is an
international language inevitable, but also a necessity for trade, commerce and economic
expansion in the 21st century.
The critics opposing the adoption of an international official language argue that it would
lead to a loss of cultural identity. However, the use of an international official language
doesn’t mean that local languages will die out. For example, English already functions as
a kind of unofficial international language but this doesn’t mean that people solely
converse in English or they neglect their own language. English is used in specific
contexts (trade, business, etc) and native languages are used for everyday instruction.
In brief, as the world becomes smaller the need for an official international language
seems unavoidable. English has already assumed this role although its status is
unofficial. In my view, the use of either an official or unofficial international language is
necessary to facilitate communication in a time of rapid globalization.
