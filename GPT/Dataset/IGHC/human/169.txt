I certainly agree that people who come up with new ideas; in other words those who
'invent' or 'discover' things are terribly important to society as a whole. However, I also
think there is a role in society for good imitators.
No one would deny that key individuals must be thanked for providing us with certain
facilities that we use every day. Where, would we be, for example, without basic items
such as the washing machine, the television and, more recently, the computer? These
items are now used so regularly that we tend to take them for granted.
In fact, the society we live in today has become increasingly consumer-oriented, and
while it may be possible to constantly update and improve consumer goods, not everyone
where I live can afford the prices of these innovations. Furthermore not everyone lives in
an area that has accessibility to the latest models on the market. For this reason, there is
a value to be placed on being able to provide good copies of expensive items.
Having said that, certain innovations have a more serious impact on our lives than
consumer goods and cannot easily be replicated. Vital medicines like penicillin and
vaccines against dangerous diseases also exist because people made continual efforts to
develop them. Scientific ideas such as these enable us to live longer and escape illness.
