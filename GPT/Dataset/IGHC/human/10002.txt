Nobody can argue that the acquisition of knowledge is more fun and easier with
computers. The mere activity of touching and exploring this device constitutes an
enjoyable task for a kid. This, accompanied with the relaxing attitude and software
interactivity, usually conduce to a better grasping of new knowledge. At a higher
educational level; the availability of digital books, simulator and other academic materials,
provide the student with an ever accessible source of information, that otherwise would
not be at hand.
But, besides the increasing complexity and behavior of intelligent software, which is
usually embedded in the academic digital material, the need of human interaction in the
learning process will always be present, at least in the foreseeable future. There is the
necessity for a human being to be able to determine what the specifics needs of each
individual are. The expertise of a teacher in how to explain and adapt complex concepts
to different individuals can hardly be mimicked by a computer, no matter how
sophisticated its software is.
As computers are becoming a common tool for teaching, teachers should be more aware
of their role as guides in the acquisition of knowledge rather than transmitters of facts.
They have to be open minded to the changes that are taking places, keep updated and
serve as a problem solvers in the learning process, thus allowing students to discover the
fact for themselves.
To summarize, in my personal view, teachers play and will play an important role in the
classroom, especially at the primary level. No matter how complex computers become,
there will be no replacement for the human interaction, but in the way haw this interaction
takes place.
