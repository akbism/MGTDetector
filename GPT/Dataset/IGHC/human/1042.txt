New factories often bring many good things to a community, such as jobs and increased
prosperity. However, in my opinion, the benefits of having a factory are outweighed by the
risks. That is why I oppose the plan to build a factory near my community.
I believe that this city would be harmed by a large factory. In particular, a factory would
destroy the quality of the air and water in town. Factories bring smog and pollution. In the
long run, the environment will be hurt and people’s health will be affected. Having a
factory is not worth that rise.
Of course, more jobs will be created by the factory. Our population will grow. To
accommodate more workers, more homes and stores will be needed. Do we really want
this much growth, so fast? If our town is going in growth, I would prefer slow growth with
good planning. I don’t want to see rows of cheaply constructed townhouses. Our quality of
life must be considered.
I believe that this growth will change our city too much. I love my hometown because it is
a safe, small town. It is also easy to travel here. If we must expand to hold new citizens,
the small-town feel will be gone. I mould miss that greatly.
A factory would be helpful in some ways. However, I feel that the dangers are greater
than the benefits. I cannot support a plan to build a factory here, and hope that others feel
the same way.
