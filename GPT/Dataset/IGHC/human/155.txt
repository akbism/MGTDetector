Today's world has been divided into developing and industrialised countries which the
main difference between them is the amount of money that governments apply in
important sectors such as education, health and commerce. Most of the poorer nations
are buried in debts as a result of their unbalanced finances which are reflect in a failed
health care, an unstructured education system and a weak international trade. This
vicious cycle will continue indefinitely unless wealthier nations show interest in minimizing
the worldwide economic differences, as well as taking more responsibility for assisting
unfortunate countries.
Most of the African countries live in sub-human conditions because of the extreme
poverty, upheaval, hunger, disease, unemployment, lack of education and both
inexperienced and corrupt administrations. The devastating consequences of the AIDS
epidemic in those countries could improve if the infected populations receive free drugs to
control the disease, have access to health professionals and get information on how to
prevent its spread. But this can only be achieved through international help programs in
which leaders of the world's richest countries donate medicine and also send doctors and
nurses to treat and educate those in need.
Moreover, most of the poor countries rely on selling agricultural products and raw material
to rich nations and buying industrialized products from them resulting in a huge financial
deficit. Consequently,
they borrow a significant amount of money from the World Bank to try to improve their
broken economies, but sometimes the money disappears with no significant changes and
they cannot even pay the interest to the bank. Regarding this issue, last year the G8,
which is comprised of leaders of the eight richest nations, decided to forgive billions of
dollars worth of debt owed by the world?s poorest nations. In addition, they developed
adequate loan programs to financially assist those countries.
In conclusion, leaders of the industrialised countries play an indispensable role in
assisting developing nations deal with essential areas such as health, education and
trade. Also, their aid is the key to breaking the vicious cycle, which results in poverty and
death.
