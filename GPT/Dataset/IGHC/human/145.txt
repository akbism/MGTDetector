I tend to agree that young children can be negatively affected by too much time spent on
the computer every day. This is partly because sitting in front of a screen for too long can
be damaging to both the eyes and the physical posture of a young child, regardless of
what they are using the computer for.
However, the main concern is about the type of computer activities that attract children.
These are often electronic games that tend to be very intense and rather violent. The
player is usually the ‘hero’ of the game and too much exposure can encourage children to
be self-centred and insensitive to others.
Even when children use a computer for other purposes, such as getting information or
emailing friends, it is no substitute for human interaction. Spending time with other
children and sharing nonvirtual experiences is an important part of a child's development
that cannot be provided by a computer.
In spite of this, the obvious benefits of computer skills for young children cannot be
denied. Their adult world will be changing constantly in terms of technology and the
Internet is the key to all the knowledge and information available in the world today.
Therefore it is important that children learn at an early age to use the equipment
enthusiastically and with confidence as they will need these skills throughout their studies
and working lives.
I think the main point is to make sure that young children do not overuse computers.
Parents must ensure that their children learn to enjoy other kinds of activity and not simply
sit at home, learning to live in a virtual world.
