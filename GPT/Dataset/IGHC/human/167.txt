As a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become
stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries. Just like movie stars,
they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars.
Many people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries
with those of top surgeons or research scientists, or even leading politicians who have the
responsibility of governing the country. However, sports salaries are not determined by
considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or
she holds. Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and the level of
public support that successful stars can generate. So the notion of ‘fairness’ is not the
issue.
Those who feel that sports stars’ salaries are justified might argue that the number of
professionals with real talent are very few, and the money is a recognition of the skills and
dedication a person needs to be successful. Competition is constant and a player is
tested every time they perform in their relatively short career. The pressure from the
media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight. So all of these factors may
justify the huge earnings.
Personally, I think that the amount of money such sports stars make is more justified than
the huge earnings of movie stars, but at the same time, it indicates that our society places
more value on sport than on more essential professions and achievements.
