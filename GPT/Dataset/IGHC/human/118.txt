Man, through the ages, has undergone many changes from the time when he depicted a
herd of mammoths on the walls of his cave to these days when he can create beautiful
pictures and even make coffee by use of computer technologies without leaving his
favorite chair. The 20th century made huge steps in developing computer technologies
and reached many goals that made our life much easier. What should we expect in the
21st century?
First of all, I think that the pace of our life will speed up: we will move faster from one
place to another, from one continent to another using high speed jet airplanes. Second of
all, I believe that we will be able to do many things that take much time now without
leaving our house. Computers will be everywhere including out clothes. Many people will
have chips and mini computers inserted in their heads to hold huge amount of information
and have a quick access to it.
But what will be the most amazing thing in the 21st century is the flights to the outer
space and Mars that will be available to all people. Scientists say that Mars has many
things similar to the Earth's. Moreover, they say that with the help of modern technology
people can artificially create conditions that will allow people to live there on the constant
basis.
To sum up, I am sure that many amazing changes will be brought by the 21st century.
Furthermore, I think that with the help of the contemporary technologies people can do
many things that were even difficult to imagine a century ago. So, nowadays it is rather
difficult and even impossible to imagine all changes that will happen in the next decades.
