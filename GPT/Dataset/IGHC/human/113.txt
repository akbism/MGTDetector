The twentieth century has brought with it many advances. With those advances, human
lives have changed dramatically. In some ways life is worse, but mostly it is better.
Changes in food preparation methods, for example, have improved our lives greatly.
The convenience of preparing food today is amazing. Even stoves have gotten too slow
for us. Microwave cooking is much easier. We can press a few buttons and a meal is
completely cooked in just a short time. People used to spend hours preparing an ovencooked meal, and now they can use that time for other, better things. Plus, there are all
kinds of portable, prepackaged foods we can buy. Heat them in the office microwave, and
lunch at work is quick and easy.
Food preparation today allows for more variety. With refrigerators and freezers, we can
preserve a lot of different foods in our homes. Since technology makes cooking so much
faster, people are willing to make several dishes for even a small meal. Parents are more
likely to let children be picky, now that they can easily heat them up some prepackaged
macaroni and cheese on the side. Needless to say, adults living in the same house may
have very different eating habits as well. If they don’t want to cook a lot of different dishes,
it’s common now to eat out at restaurants several times a week.
Healthful eating is also easier than ever now. When people cook, they use new fat
substitutes and cooking sprays to cut fat and calories. This reduces the risk of heart
disease and high cholesterol. Additionally, we can buy fruits and vegetable fresh, frozen
or canned. They are easy to prepare, so many of us eat more of those nutritious items
daily. A hundred years ago, you couldn’t imagine the process of taking some frozen fruit
and ice from the freezer, adding some low-fat yogurt from a plastic cup and some juice
from a can in the refrigerator, and whipping up a low-fat smoothie in the blender!
Our lifestyle is fast, but people still like good food. What new food preparation technology
has given us is more choices. Today, we can prepare food that is more convenient,
healthier, and of greater variety than ever before in history.
