It is certainly very understandable that some governments should start looking at ways of
limiting their populations to a sustainable figure. In the past, populations were partly
regulated by frequent war and widespread disease, but in recent years the effects of
those factors have been diminished. Countries can be faced with a population that is
growing much faster than she nation's food resources or employment opportunities and
whose members can be condemned to poverty by the need to feed extra mouths. They
identify population control as a'means to raising living standards.
But how should it be achieved? Clearly, this whole area is a very delicate personal and
cultural issue. Many people feel that this is not a matter for the state. They feel this is one
area of life where they have the right to make decisions for themselves. For that reason, it
would seem that the best. approach would be to work by persuasion rather than
compulsion This could be done by a process of education that points out the way a
smaller family can mean an improved quality of life for the family members, as well as less
strain on the country's perhaps very limited, resources.
This is the preferred way. Of course if this docs not succeed within a reasonable time
scale, it may be necessary to consider other measures. such as tax incentives or childbenefit payments for small families only. These are midway between persuasion and
compulsion.
So. yes. it is sometimes necessary, but governments should try very hard to persuade
first. They should also remember that this is a very delicate area indeed, and that social
engineering can create as many problems as it solves?
