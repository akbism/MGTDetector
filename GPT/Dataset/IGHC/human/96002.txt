The issue of whether we should force parents to immunise their children against
common diseases is, in my opinion, a social rather than a medical question. Since we are
free to choose what we expose our bodies to in the way of food, drink, or religion for that
matter, why should the question of medical 'treatment' be any different?
Medical researchers and governments are primarily interested in overall statistics and
trends and in money-saving schemes which fail to take into consideration the individual's
concerns and rights. While immunisation against diseases such as tetanus and whooping
cough may be effective, little information is released about the harmful effects of
vaccinations which can sometimes result in stunted growth or even death.
The body is designed to resist disease and to create its own natural immunity through
contact with that disease. So when children are given artificial immunity, we create a
vulnerable society which is entirely dependent on immunisation. In the event that mass
immunisation programmes were to cease, the society as a whole would be more at risk
than ever before.
In addition there is the issue of the rights of the individual. As members of a society, why
should we be obliged to subject our children to this potentially harmful practice? Some
people may also be against immunisation on religious grounds and their needs must also
be considered.
For these reasons I feel strongly that immunisation programmes should not be obligatory
and that the individual should have the right to choose whether or not to participate.
