There is plenty of evidence to suggest that children are overweight and the situation is
getting worse, according to the medical experts. I feel there are a number of reasons for
this.
Some people blame the fact that we are surrounded by shops selling unhealthy, fatty
foods such as chips and fried chicken, at low prices. This has created a whole generation
of adults who have never cooked a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these
restaurants, then children would not be tempted to buy take-away food.
There is another argument that blames the parents for allowing their children to become
overweight. I tend to agree with this view, because good eating habits begin early in life,
long before children start to visit fast food outlets. If children are given chips and
chocolate rather than nourishing food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat,
they will go for the sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their
lives.
There is a third factor, however, which contributes to the situation. Children these days
take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front
of the television or their computers and play video games. Not only is this an unhealthy
pastime, it also gives them time to eat more junk food. What they need is to go outside
and play active games or sport.
The two views discussed play an equal role in contributing to the problem, but I think we
have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as steering them away from
fast food outlets and bad eating habits. We need to have a balanced approach.
