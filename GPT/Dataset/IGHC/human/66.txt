It is often claimed that physical punishment will damage children in later life. Opponents of
corporal punishment claim that the children will grow up to become delinquents or even
beat their wives. However, many happily married adults today were slapped when they
were younger but have never hit their spouses. Another point often made is that physical
punishment teaches children that you can use force to make others do what you want. In
fact children brought up well soon learn that force by itself is nothing - it must be
associated with right. Finally, some people say that punishing a child by smacking him will
damage the relationship between the child and the parents. This is clearly wrong.
Children who understand the reasons for rules will be happier than children who are not
given clear guidelines.
There are definitely concerns about physical punishment. Some parents lose control and
can injure children - even breaking bones or causing bruises. Others can use violence
excessively or as the only method of discipline. In this case, the child will be hurt, fearful
and anxious and will not learn to distinguish right from wrong. The biggest problem with
physical violence is when it is not appropriate to the age of the child. It can be very
effective to quickly smack a two-year-old who is screaming. However, it is not effective to
beat a 16-year-old who is late for school once again.
In conclusion, physical punishment can be a useful method of discipline. However it
should be the last choice for parents. If we want to build a world with less violence we
must begin at home, and we must teach our children to be responsible.
