Animals have been used in scientific research for centuries, and the use of animals in testing new drugs and procedures is still a hotly debated topic. On the one hand, some people argue that using animals in this way is cruel and unnecessary, while others believe that it is a necessary part of medical progress. 

It is undeniable that animals can suffer in the process of testing new drugs and procedures. Animals are often subjected to painful and potentially fatal experiments, and this raises serious ethical issues. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the results of animal experiments will be applicable to humans, meaning that the pain and suffering endured by animals may be for nothing. 

However, it is also true that testing new drugs and procedures on animals is sometimes the only way to ensure the safety of humans. For example, if a new drug is to be released to the public, it must first be tested on animals to make sure it is safe for human use. Similarly, if a new medical procedure is to be used on humans, it must first be tested on animals to make sure it is safe and effective. In this way, animal testing can be seen as a necessary evil if we want to make sure that new drugs and procedures are safe for humans.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use animals in testing new drugs and procedures should be based on a careful consideration of the ethical, scientific, and practical implications. On the one hand, the ethical concerns of animal testing must be taken seriously, and any unnecessary suffering should be avoided. On the other hand, animal testing can be a vital part of medical progress, and should not be dismissed out of hand. It is therefore important to find a balance between these two perspectives in order to ensure that animals are treated humanely, while also making sure that new drugs and procedures are safe for human use.
