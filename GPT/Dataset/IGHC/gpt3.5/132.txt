In today's world, the amount of money being paid to international entertainers, including sports personalities, is often seen as excessive and unjustified. This is particularly true when considering the amount of poverty and inequality that exists in the world. While it is understandable that these entertainers, including sports personalities, should be compensated for their talents and hard work, it is difficult to justify the millions of dollars they often receive when so many people around the world are living in poverty.

The entertainment industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, and the salaries of its stars are often seen as a reflection of their worth. However, it is important to remember that these salaries are often out of proportion with the amount of money that is available to other people in the world. It is understandable that entertainers and sports personalities should be well-paid for their work, but it is difficult to justify the millions of dollars they often receive when there are so many people in the world living in poverty.

The money that is paid to international entertainers and sports personalities could be better spent on helping those in need. The money could be used to provide food, shelter, and healthcare to those who are living in poverty. This could have a far greater impact on reducing poverty than the money that is being spent on celebrity salaries.

In conclusion, while it is understandable that international entertainers and sports personalities should be well-paid for their work, it is difficult to justify the millions of dollars they often receive when so many people in the world are living in poverty. The money that is being spent on celebrity salaries could be better spent on helping those in need.
