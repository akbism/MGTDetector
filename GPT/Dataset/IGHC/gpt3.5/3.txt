The debate over whether college or university education should be available to all students or only to good students has been a long-standing one. On one hand, those who believe that higher education should be available to all students argue that it is a right of every individual to have access to higher education, regardless of their academic performance. They believe that higher education can open up many doors and opportunities, and that everyone should have the opportunity to benefit from it. On the other hand, those who believe that higher education should be available only to good students argue that it is a privilege that should not be given to everyone. They argue that higher education is a costly endeavor, and that only those who have proven themselves to be academically capable should be given the opportunity to pursue it.
