Disruptive school students can have a negative influence on their peers and the learning environment, and it is understandable that many people may think that these students should be grouped together and taught separately. However, I disagree with this solution.

Rather than separating disruptive students from the rest of the student body, I believe that the best option is to provide them with additional support and guidance. This could take the form of one-on-one tutoring, counselling, or other forms of intervention. By providing these students with the necessary support, they can learn how to better manage their behaviour and be better equipped to learn in a regular classroom setting.

Separating disruptive students from the rest of the student body could have a negative impact on their self-esteem and social development. Without the opportunity to interact with their peers, they may become isolated and feel like they are being punished for their behaviour. This could lead to further disruption in the classroom and a lack of motivation to learn.

In addition, separating disruptive students from the rest of the student body could lead to a further divide between these students and their peers. This could lead to feelings of resentment and create a hostile environment in the classroom.

In conclusion, I believe that the best solution to disruptive school students is to provide them with additional support and guidance, rather than separating them from the rest of the student body. This way, they can learn how to better manage their behaviour and be better equipped to learn in a regular classroom setting.
