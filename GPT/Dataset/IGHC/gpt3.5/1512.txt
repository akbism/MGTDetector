In this modern era, it is undeniable that we are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. From businesses to hospitals, crime detection to flying planes, computers are used in almost every sector of life. This dependence on computers has made life easier and more efficient than ever before.

For instance, computers are used in businesses to maintain records, track inventory, and manage accounts. Businesses have become more efficient and profitable due to the use of computers. In hospitals, computers are used to store patient records, track medical history, and even monitor vital signs. This makes it easier for doctors to diagnose and treat patients quickly and accurately.

In addition, computers are used in crime detection to identify suspects and collect evidence. This helps the police to quickly solve cases and bring criminals to justice. Computers are also used to fly planes, as they are able to process data quickly and accurately. This helps to ensure the safety of passengers and crew members.

Overall, computers have become an integral part of our lives and we have become heavily dependent on them. They have made life easier, more efficient, and safer than ever before. However, it is important to note that the use of computers should be balanced with the use of human judgement and intuition. This will help to ensure that the benefits of computers are maximized while minimizing potential risks.
