The idea that the government should not invest in theatres and sports stadiums and should instead allocate more money to medical care and education is a debatable topic. On the one hand, some people may argue that these are luxuries and the government should focus its resources on more important areas. On the other hand, there are those who believe that theatre and sports are essential for a healthy society and should therefore be funded by the government. 

It is true that medical care and education are essential components of any society and they should be given priority over other areas. Without adequate medical care and education, a society cannot thrive and progress. However, it is also important to recognize the importance of theatre and sports in a healthy and balanced society. Theatre and sports are not luxuries, but rather essential elements of a healthy society. They provide an outlet for creativity and expression, and also help to build a sense of community and belonging. 

The world would be a very different place without Shakespeare and the Olympics. Theatre and sports provide entertainment, inspiration and an opportunity for people to come together and celebrate. Without these forms of entertainment, people would lack the opportunity to express themselves, and the world would be a much duller place. The Olympics, in particular, is a celebration of human achievement and brings people together from all over the world. 

In conclusion, while medical care and education should be given priority, it is also important to recognize the importance of theatre and sports in a healthy society. The world would be a very different place without Shakespeare and the Olympics, and the government should invest in these areas in order to promote a healthy and balanced society.
