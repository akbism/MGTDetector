Sports have been an integral part of our lives since time immemorial. It is not only a source of entertainment, but also an important activity that has immense physical, mental and social benefits. Unfortunately, due to the rapid urbanization and industrialization, sports have been neglected and are slowly disappearing from our lives.

It is time to act and save our sports. Governments, organizations and individuals should come together to promote sports and make it an integral part of our lives. Governments should make sports a priority in their budget and allocate funds to promote sports. They should also introduce policies that encourage people to take part in sports activities. Organizations should also come forward and sponsor sports events and provide financial assistance to athletes.

Individuals also have a major role to play in saving sports. They should make an effort to participate in sports activities and encourage their children to do the same. Parents should also ensure that their children have access to sports facilities and equipment. They should also encourage their children to take up sports as a career.

In addition to this, sports should be made a part of the school curriculum. Schools should have adequate sports facilities and provide adequate time for students to participate in sports activities. This will help to inculcate the importance of sports in the minds of the students.

To conclude, sports are an important part of our lives and we must take measures to save them. Governments, organizations and individuals should come together to promote sports and make it an integral part of our lives. This will help to ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the physical, mental and social benefits of sports.
