The debate over whether or not families who do not send their children to government-financed schools should be required to pay taxes that support universal education is a complex one. On one hand, it is argued that everyone should have an equal opportunity to access education, regardless of their financial situation. On the other hand, it is argued that those who choose not to use the government-funded school system should not be expected to pay for it. 

The argument in favor of requiring taxes to support universal education is that it ensures that everyone has the same access to education, regardless of their financial situation. This ensures that no one is denied the opportunity to receive an education due to their familyâ€™s financial situation. This can be especially important for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not otherwise have access to a quality education. It also ensures that the education system is funded adequately, allowing for better quality education for all. 

However, there is also a strong argument against requiring taxes to support universal education for those who do not use the government-financed school system. It could be argued that those who choose not to use the government-funded school system should not be expected to pay for it. This could be especially true if the family chooses to send their children to a private school or to homeschool them. It could be argued that they should be allowed to keep the money they would have paid in taxes, to use as they see fit. 

In conclusion, the debate over whether or not families who do not send their children to government-financed schools should be required to pay taxes that support universal education is a complex one. While it can be argued that everyone should have an equal opportunity to access education, it can also be argued that those who choose not to use the government-funded school system should not be expected to pay for it. Ultimately, this is a decision that should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual circumstances of each family.
