It can no longer be debated that all countries must work towards embracing improvements in health, education and trade in order to develop their nation. Developing countries however have historically faced the burden of economic and political instability, poverty, disease and lack of access to education and technology, resulting in a lack of resources and awareness of development. Hence, it is necessary that the governments of the richer nations take on a more active role in helping the poorer nations develop.

For instance, while the responsibility of providing basic medical facilities largely rests with the government of the poorer countries, richer countries should step in with financial aid and technical expertise to ensure that proper implementation of the same is achieved. Expert advice offered by the government of richer nations may prove to be invaluable in accelerating the growth of health systems in poorer nations. Furthermore, such nations should consider offering scholarships, grants and other such opportunities for students and faculty members to pursue higher education for their own benefit as well as for their respective nations.

Simultaneously, it is also necessary that the government of richer nations provide assistance to the developing nations in terms of resources, technology and also facilitate fair trade. This will go a long way in encouraging progress and development in the poorer nations. For example, the knowledge and expertise of scientists, engineers and health workers in the field of medical, education and research should be transferred to the developing nations, provided at nominal fees or even free of cost. Moreover, investment in research and development based activities, promotion of entrepreneurial initiatives and the establishment of effective mechanisms of trade are essential to support the growth of the poorer countries.

Overall, it is apparent that the developing countries require assistance from the richer countries in order to prosper. The governments of the richer nations should, therefore, take responsibility for helping the poorer countries in areas such as health, education and trade. It is therefore clear that by helping the poorer nations, richer countries may not just be achieving development for their own countries, but also for their weaker more vulnerable counterparts.
