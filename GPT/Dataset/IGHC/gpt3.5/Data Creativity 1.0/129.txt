The debate on an appropriate retirement age has been on-going for quite some time now. It is clear that opinions on this topic vary from one country to the other, from one individual to another. I believe the appropriate retirement age should be closely linked to the individuals’ abilities and health, and not necessarily dictated by a certain number. An individual’s physical and mental well-being should take precedence over any legal regulations.

It is important to note that physical and mental capacity to work varies from one individual to the other. For example, a person with a disability would struggle to work longer than an able-bodied. A combination of medical examinations and individual assessments should guide people when choosing their retirement age. Age should not be a milestone but rather a guideline to guide the decision making process.

Moreover, the choice of a retirement age should take into account that an aging population needs to balance their needs with those of a younger generation. It is critical that younger workers are given opportunity to progress in their careers; hence older people should consider carefully when choosing the best time for them to move away from paid employment.

Finally, people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment until their physical and mental capabilities begin to reduce significantly. There is nothing worse than forcing people to retire when they are not ready to, just to make space for a younger generation. Thus I believe that people should be allowed to choose for themselves when the best time for them to retire is, taking into consideration their personal health, financial stability and their contribution to the workforce.
