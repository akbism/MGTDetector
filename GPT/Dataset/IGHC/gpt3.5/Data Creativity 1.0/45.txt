Advertising has its pros and cons, and there are many diverging opinions about its effects. In the context of this essay, it is important to note that the view that advertising encourages us to buy things we do not need has some truth to it, while advertisements can also inform us about products that may improve our lives. 

Firstly, when it comes to advertising, there is no doubt that it can influence our desires and steer us in the direction of products that we may not actually need. A common example of this might be the latest phone or laptop model that promises features that the existing model, still working perfectly fine, does not offer. The alluring of advertising can play to our insecurities or convince us that a certain material item can make us happier or more successful. In this sense, it is clear that advertisements can lead to wasteful and unnecessary purchases. 

On the other hand, advertising also has its merits, since it can introduce us to products that can benefit our lives in meaningful ways. For example, if a new type of home appliance is released with energy-saving capabilities and robust features that match our needs, then advertisement may bring these products to our attention and serve as a reminder of their existence. Similarly, advertising can be used to create awareness of health, safety, and economic solutions that can greatly improve our lives.

To conclude, it can be said that advertising does have the potential to lead to wasteful spending, but it can also provide valuable information about products and services that can potentially benefit our lives. Thus, it is important to differentiate between advertisements that encourage us to buy unnecessary things and those that inform us of useful solutions.
