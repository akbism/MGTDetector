The debate on whether or not parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their teenage children between the age of 15 to 18 is an ongoing one. Some believe that parents should have a say in their childâ€™s decision irrespective of their age, while others suppose that teens should be given the opportunity to grow and learn about themselves through their own mistakes. Having closely considered both arguments, I agree that parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their teenage children, albeit with some moderation.

Firstly, a child of any age requires the emotional and physical stability that only a parent or close relative can provide. This is essentially why these elder individuals possess more mature understanding and approach to life, more so when rest of the family is lost in their own chaos. Secondly, a parent or adult relative carrying better experience and knowledge, is more likely to take wise decisions which not just serves their interest in short term but also works in their benefit in long run. In addition, considering that 15 to 18 year-olds cannot legally work or enter into contracts, these elderly adults are better positioned to help them make the right decision in consultation with their peers.

Having said that, it is important that adults put the blame on their children at bay. Since these teens are already coming to terms with an array of complex emotions like making self-identity, they should not be overloaded with the extra burden of being pressed to take decisions. Hence, it is imperative that parents and other adults just offer guidance and be a support system for their teenaged children, instead of bearing the flag for their decision. Moreover, adults should respect the autonomy of their teens to make a mistake in order to cultivate self-learning, success and make them responsible for their own lives. 

In conclusion, it is wise to acknowledge the support and guidance of a parent or another adult relational the teenager's life when it comes to important decisions. Nevertheless, it is equally important that adults afford the teenager their space and respect their emotional space by helping them make decisions instead of having a say in them.
