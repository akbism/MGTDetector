The debate regarding corporal punishment to discipline children has been around for decades, with a range of solutions having been proposed. Despite the various alternative methods of discipline that are available to parents today, there are still those who choose to use physical punishment to reinforce good behaviour, or to prevent and punish inappropriate behaviour. Whilst many parents see positive results from this approach, many people consider physical punishment to be wrong, believing that it damages the emotional and psychological development of the child. 

Supporters of the physical punishment approach often cite that it provides a swift and effective method of disciplining a disobedient or badly behaving child. This immediate response can help to ensure that the behaviour does not continue and does not become a long-term issue. Furthermore, physical punishment gives children clear boundaries and can demonstrate the gravity of the transgression. Punishment is also believed to instill a sense of morality in the child, teaching them that certain actions bring consequences.

Opponents of corporal punishment argue that it has serious psychological consequences. It can lead to the child feeling humiliated, angry and resentful, placing a strain on the parent-child relationship. Furthermore, depending on the severity of the punishment, it can cause physical aggression in the child and make them more likely to bully other children or develop violent behaviour in adulthood. Additionally, physical punishment fails to teach the child anything, as they don’t understand why they’ve been disciplined in this way, as opposed to more constructive methods such as verbally explaining the reasons why the behaviour is unacceptable and the consequences that can follow. 

In conclusion, it is clear that whilst physical punishment does have its benefits when used correctly, it is important for parents to understand the implications of this approach, both immediate and potentially long-term. There is a strong risk that the child will not learn from this behaviour, and it can have damaging consequences for their relationship with the parent. For this reason, any parent who is considering the use of physical punishment should take great care when doing so, and consider alternative methods which may be more effective in teaching the child about appropriate behaviour.
