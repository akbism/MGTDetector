News editors have a great influence on what kind of news the global public gets to hear about and read about. The news that we get to watch on television or read about in newspapers is often highly biased, pointing out conflicts and political maneuvering. News editors strategically choose what to broadcast or report as it proves to be beneficial for their respective firms. 

The most influential factor which shapes the decisions of news editors is the political climate. Politicians are by nature sensitive and thereby, they often try to manipulate the news around them. News editors exploit this tactic by promoting their own political agendas. Even when their core idea is self-benefit, news editors are able to deceive viewers with the information they provide. 

The information presented by news editors can also be influenced by their financial means. Big news media houses often spend tens of millions of dollars on advertising and marketing, while smaller firms struggle to make an impact. Financially well invested news sources have the capability to sway the opinions of individuals and can thus, direct the news to a desirable outcome. 

Another factor which contributes to the decisions of news editors is repetition. News editors often tend to report the same kind of news over and over again, making it easier for viewers to get used to bad news. This is a psychological addiction which makes people vulnerable to negative news instead of positive and inspiring news. 

In my opinion, the world requires a balance between positive and negative news. Although the truth always hurts, it is important to look at the bright side. Positive news should be reported just as much or even more than negative news as it can inspire people to contribute to a better world. If news editors reported more positive news and stories that people could learn from, a healthier environment could be established that encourages creativity, imagination, and drive.
