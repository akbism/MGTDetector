In recent decades, space exploration has been a controversial topic. Some people are of the opinion that space exploration is a giant waste of resources, whereas others are in contention that it hugely benefits mankind in terms of technological advancements, innovative developments and increased understanding of the universe. In this essay, I will outline both sides of the debate and draw a conclusion on how this debate should be settled. 

Firstly, letâ€™s discuss the argument presented by those who think space exploration is a huge waste of money and resources. They point out that the money spent on research could be diverted towards human welfare causes like health, education and food distribution in poorer parts of the world. Also, with even the most advanced space programmes such as the Apollo 11 mission, the return of investment is limited, making the expense an unnecessary one. 

However, those in favour of space exploration come up with various arguments to support their stance. One of the major ones is that it fosters technological advancements which benefit humanity in many ways. For example, the research done on satellites and telecommunications technology in order to support astronaut journeys in space have been adapted to build innovative solutions to medical and technological problems on Earth. In addition, the knowledge we gain through such research also helps in understanding the evolution of the universe and our own place in it. 

Proponents also point out that, although the money spent on space exploration may appear to be immense, it is actually a minuscule part of the overall expenditure of governments worldwide. This begs the question that, if the money can be so easily spared for projects with little or no immediate return of benefit, why not spend it on something that has the potential to revolutionise the understanding of life and the universe? 

In conclusion, it cannot be denied that space exploration has some inherent risks and financial costs associated with it. However, we must consider the potential scientific benefits that it has to offer and the possible developments in research and technology which it might unlock. For these reasons, I believe that the expense of space exploration should be warranted and the debate should be settled in its favour.
