People's ideas are paramount to the progress of not just one individual or a corporation, or a sector, but to the progress of the entire human race. This progress is the very lifeblood for societies across nations, each vying for an improved quality of life for its citizens. In this regard, it would then be said that people with original ideas are of much greater value to society than those who are merely adept at replicating the creations of others.

Original thinkers can be seen as the idea generators for human societies. They help to push our collective knowledge ever forward, by finding the solutions to problems and offering innovative approaches to subjects that may have otherwise been unsolved. This source of originality and innovation is invaluable to society, as it encourages more constructive thought and more proactive responses, which is key to keeping up with increasing global competition in every industry.

However, copying the ideas of others also has its value. Without the ability to capture ideas, humankind would be without the invaluable pool of knowledge available to us today. It is existing ideas that provide the base layer of learning, and it is through careful imitation and observation that people are able to build upon existing works. Without the ability to do so, many of the great works of the world would likely have been impossible.

Ultimately, it is through an equal emphasis on originality and replication that society finds true success. Originality helps to bring forth the breakthroughs humanity needs, while imitation helps to propagate these works. As such, it is fair to say that both parties are of great value to society, each playing a unique and complementary role in the global narrative.
