The jury may sound a guilty verdict but have no way to express its emotive response to the criminal’s deed. It is here that debate arises on the effectiveness of punishments for heinous criminal activities such as murder. This essay will discuss if life imprisonment is a better option than death penalty as a punishment for murderers.

It is widely accepted that life imprisonment is a draconian punishment for heinous criminal activities, including murder. Life imprisonment not only serves as a strong deterrent for would-be offenders but also assists in punishing an offender in a dignified manner. Moreover, since the punishment of life imprisonment is irreversible, there is a higher chance it would succeed in strictly control and reduce criminal activities, thereby helping establish a safer society. It is also believed that a life sentence for such criminals grants them an opportunity of spending every single day thinking about their enormity of wrong doings. Additionally, life imprisonment offers no option for parole for the offender resulting in the criminal remaining in custody for the complete term of sentence.

On the other side of the coin, the death penalty is made a final and irreversible punishment for the most serious crimes, such as murder. And, unlike life sentence, it cannot be reduced, so it ensures that the offender is permanently removed from the society. There is some opinion that certain brutal or heinous crimes demands a harsher penalty, and death penalty lies as an exemplary form of punishment. The punishment also prevents any possible re-offense by the offender as opposed to life imprisonment.

Overall, I partly agree to the statement that life in prison is a better punishment for murderers, while certain severe cases may require the death penalty. Life imprisonment can act as effective deterrent to crime, as any likelihood of parole is eliminated, allowing longer term of incarceration. This can tremendously reduce criminal activities, as society will pay more attention to the punishment for crime. Death penalty for murderers also has its advantages as it eradicates any chances of a repeat offence but I believe that, on the whole, cutting off someone’s life creates another lifestyle of crime within the society. Therefore, life in prison is a better punishment for murderers.
