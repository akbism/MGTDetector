As technology advances, Hollywoodâ€™s love affair with car chases in action movies has been on the rise. Spectacular stunts have become a feature of these movies, thrilling viewers. It is often said that these action movies may lead to increased car accidents among young drivers, as they attempt to copy what they have seen in the films. 

In my opinion, action movies that glorify car chases undoubtedly have an influence on young drivers, inspiring them to imitate the stunts they watch on screen. Although young drivers often feel invincible, they should understand that what they see in movies is often heavily exaggerated and dangerous in real-life. Replicating stunts featured in action movies can not only lead to dangerous outcomes but also violations of the law and ultimately, severe punishment. 

There are a few measures that can be taken in order to encourage young drivers to drive more safely. A great starting point would be to increase awareness about the dangers of reckless driving. Schools could incorporate education about responsible driving in to the syllabus in order to create awareness amon students, highlighting the risks associated with imitation of movie stunts. Besides this, governments could limit the kind of content shown in youthful-oriented media which glorifies reckless driving. For example, advisories and important messages about road safety could be embedded in the car chase videos, warning viewers against forming any wrong ideas. 

To conclude, although action movies containing car chases are entertaining and popular amongst young people, there is no doubt that these movies have the power to inflict bad ideas on the viewers. An increase in awareness and restrictions in youth-oriented media can help encourage young drivers to drive safely and respect the laws of the road.
