The dialogue about retiring at 65 or older has been taking place for some time now. There are strong opinions on both sides of the argument. One side believes that senior workers should be granted the respect and privilege of retiring, while the other side argues that they should continue to work because of the benefits it could bring. In my opinion, I think that senior workers should be given the right to retire at a certain age, with a few conditions attached.

Firstly, given the fact that the elderly population is ever increasing and the life expectancy is stretching out further, there is an argument that it's not fair to treat senior citizens as 'redundant' in the workplace. Many of them have developed decades of experience and knowledge that are important to share and pass onto younger generations. Allowing elderly individuals the right to retire with some form of compensation can free up job opportunities for younger members of society.

On the other hand, it's only reasonable that if older people are physically and mentally capable, they should be able to continue working if they wish. Unlike younger workers, elderly people often possess a wealth of experience and skills that would benefit both the organisation and the workforce. In addition, there are social and economic positives, as continuing employment helps to maintain financial security as well as reducing the risk of isolation and other health issues.

In conclusion, I believe that senior workers should be granted the right to retire from their job if it is reasonable to do so. This would not only be beneficial to them personally but could also potentially benefit the organisation which they have been part of, as well as society as a whole. Nevertheless, if senior workers are still able and willing to work, then they should be given that opportunity too.
