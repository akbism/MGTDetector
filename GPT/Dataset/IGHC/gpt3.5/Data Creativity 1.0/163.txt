Decision-making is an essential part of life, as it helps shape oneâ€™s future. It is often said that a person should never make an important decision alone. I agree with this statement, as I believe decisions are best when taken collectively, with the help of others.

For one thing, it is important to seek advice before making an important decision since it provides multiple perspectives. This allows an individual to make educated choices that consider all the pros and cons of each possible outcome. Receiving counsel from those around such as family members and close friends helps bring different perspectives and expanded knowledge to situations while allowing the individual the main say in the matter. For instance, if a person was considering whether to go back to school or not, a family member might suggest a few potential issues that the individual did not initially consider, such as the financial implications. By providing to the individual the necessary information, the individual can then make an informed decision.

In addition, making decisions collaboratively helps to reduce stress. Making any type of decision can be a stressful event and gathering counsel from others helps to reduce the sense of pressure that accompanies difficult or life-changing decisions. Depending on the situation, gathering support from family, friends, or professionals can be helpful in terms of keeping the individual relaxed and instilling them with the confidence they need to make well-informed decisions.

Lastly, making important decisions with the help of others can help an individual gain experience and feel more comfort in their decision-making abilities. Gaining experience can be achieved through discussions with family and friends, who has more knowledge and experience in decision-making than the individual. This will allow the individual to comprehend situations quickly and make wise decisions in the future while feeling more comforted by the decisions they make.

In conclusion, I believe that a person should never make an important decision alone, as seeking advice provides many perspectives and helps to reduce stress. Furthermore, it can provide the individual with an experience to grow in their confidence for future decisions.
