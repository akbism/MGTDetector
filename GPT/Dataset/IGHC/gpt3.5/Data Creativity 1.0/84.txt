Nowadays, in most of the places around the world, family bonds are not as strong as they used to be some years ago. This phenomenon has raised different questions as to why it is happening and how to act on it. As suggested by some scholars, there are multiple reasons for this change. 

To begin with, the hectic lifestyles most people go through could be considered as one of the key causes. People often have extreme working timetables and long hours that leave them hardly any time to spend with their family and relatives. As a consequence of this, people tend to lack the strong interpersonal relationships that are essential to preserve family ties. 

In addition, the increased access to technology and its influence over people's lives has also contributed to make family bonds weaker. Nowadays, people spend more time with their cell phones, laptops and tablets, rather than sharing with their family. This leads to a decline in traditional socialization, thus making it harder for the members of a family to connect with each other. 

On the other hand, considering the current situation, I believe that people should try to improve communication among the members of the family. One way to do this is by organizing family activities such as shopping, going to the cinema or even having a walk in the park. Apart from that, using technology in the proper way could also be beneficial. Lately, video calls and social media have been essential tools to keep families connected.

All things considered, this issue has become a problem worldwide. Therefore, it is urgent to find a solution to maintain strong family bonds. I strongly believe that motivating people to spend more time with their family and helping them to make the best use of the available technology are two great strategies to tackle this issue.
