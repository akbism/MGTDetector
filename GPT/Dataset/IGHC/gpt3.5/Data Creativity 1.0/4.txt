Learning about life can be done in two ways: by taking advice from family and friends, or through personal experience. Each has their merits and drawbacks, and often the best approach is a combination of the two.

The benefits of taking advice from family and friends are numerous. Because life is a collection of joys and lessons, the wisdom accumulated over years of life experience from family and friends can prove invaluable. With their help, we gain understanding and knowledge of how to navigate practical obstacles, emotional problems, and moral dilemmas. Advice from people who have a better understanding of the situation can translate into faster and more beneficial solutions. 

In contrast, personal experience is beneficial in that it can help one gain a real-time understanding of the world. There is nothing that teaches someone more than getting out there and exploring. Experiencing life can give invaluable wisdom and unrivalled insight that no one else can provide. 

Between the two, it can be difficult to decide which approach is better. Personally, I prefer combining the two. Taking advice, combined with personal experience, allows for a multitude of perspectives, and with them, an overall, lesser-bias understanding of the situation. This, I believe, is the best route to finding an optimal solution while gaining valuable life knowledge in the process. 

In conclusion, it is difficult to decide which approach is the best when it comes to learning about life. Taking advice from family and friends and gaining personal experience both offer advantages and, I believe, the best approach is using a combination of both.
