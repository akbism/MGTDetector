It is widely agreed that governments should prioritize the health, education, and security of its citizens. These areas require ample allocation of resources and can have profound implications on citizens’ well-being. Nonetheless, it is argued that governments should also allocate resources to art rather than just health, education and security.

In this regard, art can have a range of positive impacts. One of the most immediate effects of governments investing in art is the improvement of public spaces. Art installations, such as murals, sculptures, and gardens, could be placed in public areas to create visually aesthetic surroundings. This can be visually pleasing to citizens and encourage them to visit public areas. Furthermore, making public spaces more attractive for citizens can inspire people to go to their cities and showcase their culture. Arts and cultural initiatives can also be used to create or re-imagine public spaces, like parks, to encourage citizens to spend time outdoors. Furthermore, parks can have an important educational function, as art projects can host talks and activities that provide an opportunity to learn in an enjoyable and engaging way.

Arts and culture can also be used to promote unity and create social awareness. For instance, programs like dance classes, theater workshops, and music festivals can lessen discrimination and foster mutual understanding in communities. By celebrating different cultures, governments can also be attentive to diversity and create an atmosphere of inclusion in their countries. Additionally, art can give a voice to repressed or disadvantaged citizens. By hosting artworks, exhibitions, or awards within marginalized communities, governments can make their citizens’ work visible and give those members of society an opportunity to articulate their experiences and beliefs. 

Finally, art can bring cohesion between countries by bringing citizens from different countries together. Projects like concerts and festivals can be organized to promote an understanding between different cultures. These activities can be also sponsored by governments in other countries, which can unify and bring people from different countries together.

In conclusion, investment in art is an important requirement for governments due to the variety of positive benefits it brings in terms of its educational function, unity, and collaboration with other countries. Therefore, governments should invest in art, which may have secondary effects in the society and bring important benefits.
