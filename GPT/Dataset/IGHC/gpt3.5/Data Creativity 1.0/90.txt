Smoking cigarette in public places undoubtedly has its pros and cons. On one side, it can create a very uncomfortable and polluted atmosphere for non-smokers whereas on the other, it is a public health hazard that should have a credible legal approach. Thus, I agree with the notion of not allowing smoking in public places, especially offices in businesses. 

To start with, Passive smoking is one of the major concerns for non-smokers, who are exposed to second-hand smoking that can cause a variety of health problems including serious illnesses such as lung cancer and heart diseases. Unquestionably, it should be the right of an individual not to be exposed to smoke in an office environment which is a professional space as well as a place of concentration and performance. It’s not just the non-smokers who get affected by open smoking in any environment; even smokers themselves need to protect their body from the hazardous toxins in the cigarettes. 

The ambiance and the smell of cigarettes in the office space is not only very discomforting but also detrimental to work productivity and concentration. This means that in businesses, enforcing a strict policy of no smoking in offices can be beneficial in the long run to achieve employee capacity at it’s optimal. A better alternative can be provided to facilitate any persons interested in smoking like special smoking zones or well-designed rooms that can be used for that purpose. 

Furthermore, no smoking in public places law enables the government to subsequently take effective action and stop the public from open smoking. The law serves in mitigating the health hazards of smoking for any individual and sets a clear prohibition for the habit, lessening the addiction and abuse of it. 

In conclusion, it is better to impose a smoking ban in public places and I believe businesses should also ensure that their office spaces don’t become a place of open smoking since it is potentially damaging to both smokers as well as people who are non-smokers.
