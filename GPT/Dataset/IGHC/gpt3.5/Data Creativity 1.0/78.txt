The role of women in society has undergone a remarkable transformation in the last few decades. With an increased focus on gender equality and empowerment of women, more married women are now engaged in work outside of the home. There have been discussions around the potential consequences of this trend and whether it has adverse effects on young generations. In my opinion, although it's true that working mothers don't always have the capacity to cater to their children as much as they desire, there is still a great potential for them to provide a supportive environment, which in turn can help prevent juvenile delinquency.

At the outset, it's important to recognize the great socio-economic and emotional benefits that working mothers can give their children. With dual-income households, children will gain greater financial means, expanding their opportunities for their education, healthcare, etc. In addition, the work-life balance of a mother will contribute to a better dynamic and relationship between parents and children, as it may reduce stress, provide stability, and offer valuable lessons about work ethic, responsibility and determination.

In relative terms, working mothers are better able to educate their children about the importance of financial independence and time-management. Therefore, when faced with pressure from peers, chances of children resorting to criminal activities is likely to be reduced, particularly in todayâ€™s result-oriented world. Furthermore, some modern workplaces may even allow mothers to take flexible hours, enabling them to pick and drop their children to school and providing them with other sets of learning and supervisory opportunities.

To sum up, despite the fact that married women's presence outside the home may limit the amount of care they can give to their children, they can still influence their offspring in positive ways, both socio-economically and emotionally. Therefore, it's unfair to assume that this is often the root cause of juvenile delinquency.
