The age-old saying, ‘Parents are the best teachers’ has been debated time and time again. While some may agree with this notion, there are those who too feel that parents may not be the best teachers. In my opinion, I agree that parents are the best teachers.

To begin with, due to them being around us from the day we are born, parents often know us the best. They can follow our innate strengths and weaknesses and accordingly mould us to become better individuals. Oftentimes, parents enable the nurture of certain qualities, providing the best environment for the growth and development of their children. This way, parents are able to encourage their children in certain areas and help them recognise their ambitions. For instance, my parents’ understanding of my skills, weaknesses and voraciousness for engaging in new activities, has motivated me to pursue my interests. 

Furthermore, parents prove to be great teachers as they stand by their children, no matter their success or failure. Throughout our childhood and teenage years, they offer us valuable advice and guide us through tumultuous times. This is especially beneficial if they are supportive and non-judgmental but possess the firmness to nudge us in the right direction. As we grow older, we learn to make the right decisions on our own but it is the values that they instilled in us that helps us take the right path.

On a slightly different note, relating to the topic at hand, parents may not necessarily be the best teachers in the strict academic sense. This is because they do not possess the necessary qualifications or the extensive knowledge that a trained teacher does. Moreover, due to their overprotectiveness and the lack of authoritative knowledge, parents may go about teaching certain topics in a manner that differs from the general educational system. 

To conclude, parents may not be the go-to teachers in terms of academics, but with their unwavering love and understanding, they provide invaluable guidance and serve as exemplary teachers in life. By helping us to recognize and make use of our potential, they are the ultimate teachers of life, encouraging us to strive for excellence and stay on the right path.
