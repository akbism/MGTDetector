In recent years, the costs of medical health care have risen steeply, causing strain on governmental budgets and making it difficult for them to balance their health care finances. This has stirred debate on whether citizens should be fully responsible for their own health costs and take out private health insurance, or if it is better to have a public health system undertakes the responsibility of providing medical care to all without charge. 

Advocates of citizens being responsible for their own medical expenditure argue that private health insurance allows for a much better quality of care. As individuals are paying the cost, insurers can provide them with more comprehensive cover for treatments and specialist care, rather than having to rely solely on what is offered within the free public system. Moreover, people can have greater autonomy in choosing the best and most suitable healthcare package for themselves. 

However, many suggest that a comprehensive public health system that provides free health care services to everyone is the best advantageous way to go. This type of medical system allows for lower-income people to receive medical services regardless of their wealth and means. Furthermore, the issue of excessive costs due to medical services, especially for people on limited incomes, are also avoided. The International Labour Organization (ILO) finds that countries with social health insurance tend to have better and more equal access to health services, ensuring that citizens and residents do not become burdened with mounting medical costs.

In conclusion, though there are arguments for both sides of the debate of who should bear ultimate responsibility for covering health care costs, it is undeniably beneficial to have a public health system which ensures that the vulnerable in society have access to medical care without having to burden themselves with unaffordable expenses.
