The 21st century has brought about a radical shift in the way we work, live, and interact. With the advancement of technology, radical changes in communication and transportation will broaden access to different cultures and communities. Looming economic and environmental issues will also need to be addressed with more urgent action. 

In this century, invaluable knowledge will continue to be shared at an even faster rate through the internet and educational opportunities will reach far and wide. This increased access to education will benefit communities, create job opportunities and spur economic development. Through this, career choices will become more diverse, allowing people to pursue their dreams in different fields and receive training that have never been available before. Businesses will also have access to greater talent and will be able to operate on a larger and more global scale. 

In addition, social changes such as a diversifying public sphere will introduce more diversity and inclusion, as those in power shift to be more reflective of the population. There will be a change of mindset to include embracing different opinions and cultures, creating an open and vibrant society. 

Furthermore, there will likely be radical changes in the way transportation is managed to help with creating a greener lifestyle. Electric and autonomous cars will become more accessible, as well as faster transportation methods such as different kinds of trains and tube networks. There can also be an increased use of renewable energy, allowing for a less pollutant, and more sustainable living. 

The 21st century can bring about many radical changes. It is up to us to adapt and continue to strive to progress with the times, to create a more inclusive and sustainable lifestyle for future generations to come.
