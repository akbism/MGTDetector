In the modern world, a business’s success to some degree is judged on its ability to make a profit. The prevailing opinion is that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. While this may often be the case, I disagree with the notion that any means to make a profit is a legitimate one.

First and foremost, businesses should recognize that all their actions must be within the framework of ethical and legal boundaries. Breaching these limits carries severe implications and could jeopardize the business’s position in the market. For instance, in the automobile industry, Volkswagen was found guilty of breaking emissions laws. Consequently, the company ended up paying heavy fines and harboring a great deal of reputational damage.

Further, businesses should assume some level of social responsibility for their actions. For instance, businesses should steer clear of activities that are detrimental to the environment and society at large. Businesses should be aware of the implications of their actions on the environment and communal welfare. For example, oil production in certain parts of the world has caused large scale damage to the environment, leading to long-term adverse effects.

Finally, businesses should concede that there are certain activities that no reasonable person of sound moral judgment would consider legitimate if they result in making a profit. For example, drug trafficking in order to earn a profit is an activity which no responsible business would condone.

In conclusion, it is evident that businesses should be cognizant of the limits of what constitutes legitimate ways to make a profit. While it is often important to maximize profits, businesses that only seek to make a profit without giving due consideration to ethical and legal boundaries and social responsibility often end up paying a heavy price.
