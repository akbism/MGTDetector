Education is of paramount importance and ensuring that all people have access to it is something that all governments should focus on. Whether it should be completely free, however, is a subject of debate. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument before concluding with my opinion. 

The primary argument for free education is that a lack of access to education can contribute to inequality in society. Allowing for free access could result in better opportunities for those who canâ€™t afford the cost of education, particularly in developing countries. Free education could also allow people to develop skills which could be beneficial in terms of employment and provide them with better living standards. 

However, one of the main arguments against free education is the cost that would be involved to the nation, in particular through taxes. Much of the public expenditure could be put to better use in other areas such healthcare and infrastructure. Additionally, opponents argue that free education may actually lead to lower quality of education, as governments would be unable to afford hiring the best qualified teachers or providing the best facilities. 

In conclusion, education should continue to be affordable for everyone and there should also be measures in place to support those who are unable to pay for it. Furthermore, government should look at ways of ensuring that public expenditure is being used correctly and ensuring that the quality of education is maintained. From my point of view, free education should be paid for but with the proviso that quality is not compromised.
