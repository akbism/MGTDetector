Traffic congestion is one of the major issues troubling today's society. With the increasing number of vehicles on our roads, it has become difficult to drive around in the cities. The unbearable traffic is causing air pollution and wastage of fuel, leaving commuters with no other option but to sit in the deadlock to reach their destination. 

The most effective way to reduce the number of cars on our roads is to encourage and practice public transportation. With proper infrastructure, availability, and cheaper fares, public transportation can become an effective substitute for private vehicles. In addition, carpooling and bicycles can help reduce the overall number of cars travelling.

Apart from these, the government can also pass more stringent rules to limit the use of cars on our roads. Levying high taxes on buying and maintaining vehicles can discourage people from buying cars. Moreover, shifting the office timings for the employees may also help to ease the traffic during rush hours.

Also, on a personal level, we can limit the number of cars on our roads if we choose to walk or cycle wherever we can and use public transport. If individuals tailor their lifestyles to reduce their reliance on cars, it will add up to a great contribution in limiting the number of cars on our roads. 

For car drivers, a substitute could be to use technology. Car sharing applications such as Uber, Lyft and Ola, have helped reduce the need of cars. These applications aid people to use the vehicles which are available to them at a cheaper cost. Along with the new infrastructure, the government should also promote the use of cycle sharing and electric vehicles to reduce the emissions and enhance the safety of traffic. 

To sum up, we need to combat the increasing number of cars on our roads with the help of creative ideas and technologies. By promoting the use of public transport and encouraging walk and cycle, we can reduce the number of cars on our roads. We need to be precautious and take the initiative to reduce traffic by doing our part in limiting the number of vehicles.
