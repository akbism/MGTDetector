It is undeniable that learning a foreign language offers an enriching experience for students, offering them insight into diverse cultures and allowing them to appreciate cultural difference. In this respect, there is a strong argument that the teaching of a foreign language should be made compulsory at primary schools. However, not everyone will agree this is necessary and there are some valid reasons for this viewpoint. 

It is important to consider the resources available to schools when deciding the question of whether or not foreign language teaching should be mandatory. With the current pressure on the education system, many schools would struggle with the financial costs associated with hiring teachers and providing the materials needed to teach foreign languages. This should be taken into account when making a decision on whether or not foreign language teaching should be compulsory.

Opponents of the idea also point to the practicality of teaching foreign languages at primary school. It may not be the most appropriate setting for foreign language teaching, as primary school pupils can struggle with grammar and more complex language. The idea of teaching foreign language in primary school could also in some cases give a false impression that the language is easy to learn, when in reality it takes months, or even years of study to reach a competent level.

In conclusion, although learning a foreign language can offer an insight into foreign cultures, it is important to consider the practical implications of making foreign language teaching compulsory in all primary schools. The answer to the question depends largely on the resources and capacity of schools for delivering such instruction, and should be based on a careful assessment of the pros and cons of the idea.
