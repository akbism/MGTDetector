Technology has taken education to a whole new level and with the evolution of computers, it has become even more convenient for students to learn and acquire knowledge. However, saying that computers will soon replace teachers in the classroom and there will be no role left for them is an overly simplistic statement. Even though it is critical to implement technology in the classroom to help students learn more effectively, there are certain aspects of teaching that only an experienced teacher can provide.

Most students gain a lot more than just knowledge from a teacher. Whether it is gaining up-to-date information, sharpening practical skills, or having a mentor figure, teachers are the most vital factor in the educational environment. They are able to respond to questions, provide moral support and create an encouraging ambience in the classroom. Looking at the broader spectrum, they also ensure that students acquire a proper education which will help them in their future endeavours. Even with the tools provided by computers, teachers are the ones who initiate an interactive and enriching environment for students.

Apart from the knowledge of a particular subject, teachers have the ability to already assess their student’s overall level on an individual category and provide guidance for further improvement. It is true that computers can also make assessments, but teachers can have a deeper understanding of the students as well as their subject to provide constructive feedback. Moreover, computers can limit the socialisation among students, which is essential for growth. Teachers are the only ones who can evaluate the student’s personal needs and create the environment to help them develop a variety of skills which will help them not only in their academic life, but also their day-to-day lives.

In conclusion, it is paramount to unify technology and teachers together in the classroom rather than replacing teachers with computers. Teaching is not just about enabling knowledge, but also about creating a well rounded student. Teachers are the ones who can understand the unique abilities of the students and make changes in the curriculum accordingly to provide them with a suitable learning experience.  Computers can prove to be a great help in achieving this goal, but in the end it is the teacher who makes sure the students gain the full benefit of the technology provided.
