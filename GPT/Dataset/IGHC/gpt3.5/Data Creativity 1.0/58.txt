Nowadays, it is often believed that watching television is bad for children. Though there are some advantages of television, I disagree with the statement. 

To begin with, television helps children understand the world by providing news and current affairs programs. In fact, children can learn a great deal about the world with current affairs programs designed just for them. For instance, news programs like The Simons Foundation on Cartoon Network are meant especially to educate kids in topics ranging from politics to global warming. Also, exposure to global events, like wars, and catastrophes can increase children’s compassion and empathy. 

Furthermore, television informs children and helps build language skills. The programs on television bring the exposure to languages and cultures from all over the world. This can help kids gain more knowledge of a foreign language or culture like that of Spanish. Since, children’s brains are most receptive to absorbing new information when they are young, teaching an early foreign language has a greater impact. 

In addition, television helps children to discover new hobby. Children can explore a variety of children’s programs that allow them to explore a new hobby like gardening, mathematics, astronomy and more. By exposing kids to these activities, children can learn more about the particular activity, with the guidance of a professional to ensure that the activity is donehealthily and safely.

On the other hand, there are some important limitations of television. First, too much exposure to television can be bad for children’s mental and physical health. It has been proven that excessive TV watching can be linked to obesity, attention deficit, depression and various learning problems. In addition, television programs contain violence and indecent content that may not be suitable for children. These shows can influence children’s attitude and thinking in a negative way. 

To summarize, television can have some advantages for children but it can also cause a great deal of harm. Therefore, parents should be more aware of the effects of television and teach children the importance of limiting their TV time. With proper guidelines from parents, television can be a powerful tool for learning and growth.
