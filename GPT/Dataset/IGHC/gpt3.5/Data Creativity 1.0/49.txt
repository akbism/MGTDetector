Recently, the number of obese children in developed countries has been increasing. To explain this phenomenon, many have pointed to such problems as the growing number of fast food outlets, and others have suggested that the lack of parental supervision when it comes to the health of their children may be to blame. I believe that both of these factors contribute to this issue, but the primary responsibility ultimately falls on the individual.

On one hand, having a readily available abundance of fast food outlets in a society certainly does promote an unhealthy diet among children. This is a result of convenience and peer influence. Adverts encouraging the consumption of fast food have a huge influence on children and their eating habits. This may inadvertently lead to their frequent visits to fast food outlets, which can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle.

On the other hand, parents do play an important role when it comes to their child's health. They should ensure that the diet of their child is mainly comprised of nutritious and healthy food. As parents are responsible for providing food in the home, they can limit the amount of unhealthy food consumed. They should also introduce physical activities to help keep their child active and fit.

Ultimately, I believe that the primary responsibility to maintain a healthy lifestyle falls on the individual. They should be aware of the harm it does to their body if they eat excessively and don’t exercise. Moreover, children should be taught about healthy eating practices and the importance of physical activity by their parents and schools. That includes explaining why it is important to avoid sugary, fatty and processed foods, and the importance of staying active and eating a balanced diet.

In conclusion, while I accept that fast food outlets and parental supervision have a part to play, I feel that personal responsibility is the most important factor in a child’s health and wellbeing. With increased awareness and a better understanding of the long-term consequences of unhealthy lifestyle, children can be educated to make the right choices.
