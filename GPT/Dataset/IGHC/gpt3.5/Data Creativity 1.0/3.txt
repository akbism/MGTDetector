In today's world, opinions about the accessibility of college and university education differ greatly. Some people believe that such education should be available to all students regardless of their academic capabilities, while others think that it should be only allocated to the best students. This essay discusses these two views and explains why I agree with the latter.

Those who advocate for the idea of open access to higher education base their reasoning on the belief that making knowledge and education readily accessible empowers individuals and contributes to the future of the nation-state. They believe that everyone deserves a chance to gain knowledge regardless of their academic capabilities, and that this privilege should be available to all students.

On the other hand, those who favour access to higher education only for those academically capable, justify their stance arguing that the college or university experience should be the reward for those good students who have worked hard to achieve good results.

In my opinion, higher education should only be available to good students. I think that youth who desire to pursue a college or university education should show academic excellence, a sense of dedication, will to learn and the drive to succeed. If every student has access to higher education, regardless of their academic achievements, only those who showed the commitment to serve as an example and are the most competent, will end up furthering their study experience. Not to mention, college fees cover a lot of resources and remunerate those employed for teaching and administrative purposes, thus getting rewarding jobs is an indicator of hard work and dedication;being able to access higher education or not should be a tangible recognition of this commitment.

In conclusion, both arguments presented have their merits and demerits. I think that making knowledge and education readily available to all students is a sign of social progress and empowerment, however, the ultimate privilege of college or university education should be deserved by those hard working and dedicated students who made those experiences available to them; after all, higher education should be considered one of the best rewards to a student.
