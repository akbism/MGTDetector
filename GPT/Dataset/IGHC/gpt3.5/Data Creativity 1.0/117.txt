In the last hundred years, a lot of discoveries have been made that have greatly benefitted people in my country. However, out of all, I would say the most important and beneficial discovery has been the internet which has revolutionized the way people communicate, access knowledge and conduct business. 

To start with, the internet has enabled us to connect with anyone in the world we want to in no time. This has been extremely beneficial for people in my country as it has eliminated the geographical and temporal barriers associated with old-fashioned communication methods. For instance, no matter where they live and what time it is, people can easily stay in touch with one another over messages, emails and video calls. What’s more, the internet has made it easier for people in my country to stay connected with their families and friends abroad.

Secondly, the internet has been immensely helpful in terms of getting access to knowledge. People can now use an array of online resources – including videos, tutorials, audio clips and articles – to learn about almost anything and develop their skills. For example, many young people in my country use it to learn a new language, study new concepts or learn how to operate a machine. Consequently, they can easily upskill themselves and stand out in the competition.

Finally, the internet is also greatly helpful for business activities in my country. It enables entrepreneurs and professionals to market and promote their goods and services not only in the domestic market but also at a global level. For example, small businesses can develop their own websites to attract customers from anywhere in the world. Moreover, online platforms have made it easier for businesses to access new suppliers and generate revenue.

To sum up, among the many discoveries in the last 100 years, the internet has been the most beneficial for people in my country by enabling easy communication, providing access to knowledge and facilitating business activities.
