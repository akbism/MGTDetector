The announcement of a large factory being built near my community has polarised opinions. Some are of the view that the advantages the factory will bring to our community outweigh the disadvantages, while others are of the opinion that the disadvantages will be too much for our community to bear. On my part, having considered both sides of the issue, I believe the benefits a factory will bring to our community should be reaped.

Proponents of the factory suggest that it will provide jobs and stimulate the local economy. With unemployment rates at an all-time high, it is highly likely that the factory will offer much-needed positions to our community. A factory should also bring business opportunities to the area, evidenced by the increased traffic of shoppers. This influx of citizens should help the local businesses be profitable and fly its flag high in the global market.

On the contrary, opponents of the factory argue that it could lead to environmental damage. The factoryâ€™s water and air pollution may result in the contamination of nearby bodies of water and make the air quality of the area unbearable. Additionally, the noise and light pollution emitting from the factory could disrupt the peace and quiet of the surrounding areas. 

Despite the potential drawbacks crowding the minds of opponents, I believe that the numerous advantages that come with establishing a factory in our community will ultimately have a positive impact. With monetary resources for schools and hospitals, medical advancements, and necessary infrastructure to drive the economy and create more jobs, the factory is the missing puzzle piece to the complete development of the community.

To conclude, given the advantages that come with building a factory near my community, I support the idea and believe that we should strive to reap the benefits of this great opportunity of growth. Moreover, the government should ensure necessary implementation of pollution control measures in order to prevent any environmental damage.
