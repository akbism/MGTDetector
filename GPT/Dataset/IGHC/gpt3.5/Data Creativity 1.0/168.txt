It is undeniable that the hard work of individuals is vital to the development of an entire society. While each individual has a unique set of skills that contribute to the wider whole, artists and scientists are amongst those that are held in particularly high regard. Each of these facets of society are essential for cultural and technological development, yet it is possible to evaluate the level of appreciation for artist contributions compared to scientific advancements.

Scientific breakthroughs are at the core of our modern era, bringing about a plethora of inventions that have changed people's lives for the better. From disease-combating technologies to life-saving medical Procedures and from practical everyday appliances to cutting-edge communications hardware, the creative application of knowledge has given us access to a truly remarkable existence. It is this discovery-focused mindset that has enabled the human race to flourish since the dawn of civilisation, and so scientists are held in high regard as a direct result of their contributions.

However, it must be recognised that artistic endeavours are similarly crucial when constructing any society. Expression has been an inseparable part of human life since the beginning of our species, and it is inextricably linked to human progress. Art plays a vital role in forming cultures and imbuing societies with a sense of identity, enabling us to honour our traditions as well as explore exciting new concepts. Artistic expression can both challenge and unite people, promoting democratic discourse and driving political change. Moreover, it can be a vehicle for social justice, highlighting issues and leading the way towards a progressive society.

Considering the essential parts that both scientists and artists play within our society, it can be difficult to determine which is valued more by a given culture. Although scientific endeavour is essential for technological advancement, I believe that art is often taken for granted and is thus less appreciated by the majority of our population. This is due in part to the fact that art often goes unrecognised for its ability to effect social change, due to its naturally abstract and indirect nature; by contrast, scientific progress is usually immediately understood and is thus more likely to be rewarded.

Ultimately, it is clear that both scientific and artistic developments are crucial for the formation and progression of a successful and productive society. While our admiration for science is vital, we should also ensure that art is celebrated and appreciated in the same measure. After all, both are integral elements of the human experience.
