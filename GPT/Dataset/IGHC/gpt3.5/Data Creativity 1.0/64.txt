Leisure activities are an integral part of a healthy life, no matter what age a person is. In the context of children, some individuals argue that the time they spend playing and enjoying themselves should be educational in some way, or else it is a “complete waste of time.” I disagree with this opinion for several reasons.

For one thing, recreational activities are essential for children's overall development. According to UNICEF, play can promote better interaction with peers, develop empathy, and foster problem solving skills. Furthermore, it teaches children how to entertain themselves in creative ways and encourages them to share and cooperate with each other. Thus, play-based activities actually provide benefits far beyond those of educational ones.

On top of this, children should have the freedom to make their own choices in regards to what they spend their time doing. If parents constantly pressure them to take educational leisure activities, this could be a potential source of stress or frustration. Children should have the chance to explore, discover and hone in on their interests as they learn to prioritize their leisure time. Therefore, allowing children to freely participate in activities of their choice helps build their self-awareness and stimulates the development of life skills.

In conclusion, I feel that children should engage in leisure activities of their choice, rather than be forced to take educational ones. This not only provides the children with the freedom to explore their creative interests, but it also helps in developing important life skills. Hence, any form of leisure activity can be beneficial to a child’s well-being.
