It is true that most countries implement taxes to finance governmental bodies, schools, and other necessary organizations that provide a wide range of services, one of them being education. The debate whether families who do not send their children to government-financed schools should still pay such taxes is frequently subject to discussion.

From one point of view, taxes are used to fund a large portion of the costs that are necessary to provide educational services to certain sectors of the population that cannot afford to pay for it due to financial issues. Therefore, if families that do not send their children to government-run schools are exempted from taxation, the budget to support such services would be threatened. This could then lead to a lack in resources, from simple classroom desks to extra programs and teacher's salaries, which could eventually bring a decrease in overall educational services.

On the other hand, the obligation for all citizens, regardless of having children or not, to pay such taxes might be pushing away some families from investing in the financial wellbeing of their children by not providing them the education they need to reach their goals. It is important to consider that such families could be opting-in to alternative ways of providing education and, still, be at a financial disadvantage. Therefore, it is strongly argued that they should not be required to pay taxes to support universal education if they are not receiving any of these mandated services.

Considering that both sides of the debate do offer valid arguments, a potential solution could be the implementation of an alternative taxation scheme that exempts all families who do not enroll their children in government-financed schools whilst still providing the necessary financial support to keep them running. Tax cuts or deductions could be considered according to each family's financial annual income, allowing them to take the necessary steps to provide education to their children as they would see fit.

In conclusion, exempting families from taxation when it comes to receiving educational services from government-financed schools could be seen as unfair for those who do use them. However, creating a taxation scheme that takes into account each family's economical difficulties and distinctive education plans could be the best approach, not only in terms of fairness but also to support the government's investment in educational services.
