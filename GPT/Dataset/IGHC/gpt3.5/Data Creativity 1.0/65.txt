Physical punishment is the act of punishing a child through physical means such as spanking for discipline and is a highly debated topic. Supporters of physical punishment believe it provides children with a much needed source of discipline and is highly effective when used correctly. However, opponents state that physical punishments can lead to psychological issues and physical violence. Through examining both points of view, this essay argues that physical punishment should not be used with children. 

Firstly, opponents argue that physical punishment can lead to physical and psychological harm. According to a report by the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, physical punishments are linked to aggressive behaviour towards adults, peers and siblings. This highlights a negative effect on the development of positive behaviours and is amplified when the punishment is done in an aggressive manner. Additionally, physical punishments can cause psychological and emotional trauma such as feeling of humiliation, depression and anxiety. Hence, physical punishment should be avoided as the effects outweigh the potential gains in terms of discipline. 

On the other hand, proponents of physical punishment argue that it is highly effective in disciplining children. Supporters of physical punishment argue that it helps children understand the consequences of their wrong behaviours and will act as a deterrent for future situations. Furthermore, physical punishments can also help build character and can help children build a morals code. However, this essay argues that the use of physical punishment should be avoided as it is based on the idea that it is acceptable to solve problems with violence, which is an outlook that should not be taught to children.

In conclusion, physical punishments should be avoided when disciplining children as can lead to physical and psychological harm. Instead, emphasis should be given to positive discipline and reward systems as effective methods to mould childrenâ€™s behaviour and character. Besides, positive methods of discipline are based on the idea of reinforcing good behaviour and not violence which will benefit the overall development of children.
