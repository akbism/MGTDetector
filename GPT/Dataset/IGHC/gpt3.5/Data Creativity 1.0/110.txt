Change and dynamism are inevitable parts of life. Some of us look forward to these changes, anticipating new experiences and enjoy them, whereas some of us prefer to keep their lives exactly the same as it was and do not look for change in their habitual lifestyle. 

By welcoming change, we can explore opportunity, build new relationships, and become wiser. These people have an open mind towards new possibilities and are willing to adapt to the situation in order to get the most out of it. To emphasize the importance of embracing change, famous theorist Abraham Maslow famously said, “The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature.” 

On the other hand, some people like to keep their lives the same and view changes as a form of the chaotic unpredictability. These individuals put greater emphasis on the value of stability, predictability, and the comfort of their usual routine. They would rather maintain their current state of affairs than endure the unknown. Therefore, from their point of view, the downside of change is higher than the potential benefit they can gain from it. 

Personally, I adore the idea of new experiences as they help me overcome my fears, expand my knowledge and build unique experiences. I believe that dynamic interactions with the world around us can eventually shape us into better individuals in the long run and can contribute towards our personal growth.

Therefore, I deem change is highly important and if one keeps their lives the same, they will miss out the on huge learning opportunities. I personally would opt for embracing change while carefully balancing between the duration and intensity of the change. Anything beyond this can lead to distress and confusion. This approach helps me make the most of every situation, by identifying the potential gain or danger it may provide.
