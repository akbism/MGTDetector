The digital revolution of the 21st century has facilitated a huge change in society, particularly with regard to the computer. Some people believe that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's world, as they can be seen to cause issues such as digital distraction, cyber-crime and the loss of jobs. On the other hand, there are others who think that they are indispensable tools that modern people cannot live or work without.

To begin with, computers can be seen to be a hindrance to productivity and interpersonal relationships. The internet and a variety of apps have made it easier than ever before to be constantly connected, but this means that it can be a real challenge to stay focused on tasks and away from distractions. Social media has also been linked to a decrease in face-to-face communication and trust has been diminished in many professional and personal relationships due to artificial intelligence algorithms and activities like phishing and hacking.

Additionally, the use of computers has led to the automation of many jobs which may have previously been done by humans. While this can be convenient for companies who are able to save costs, it also results in a huge number of people being out of jobs with no substantial alternatives available.

At the same time, without computers life would be much more difficult; the speed at which tasks and research can be completed is amplified and the range of jobs, products and services have grown considerably in recent years. Products like smartphones, tablets and laptops have facilitated more convenient and creative ways of working and they have become essential tools in the current day. All sorts of data can be gathered and organized, which saves time and money in the long run.

Therefore, I believe that on balance, computers are an indispensable tool in today's world. Despite being seen as a hindrance in various aspects, the positive impact that they have had on our lives and the economies of various countries is undeniable.
