International tourism has undeniably come a long way since its advent in the 20th century. It has since developed into one of the world’s leading industries, accounting for a large portion of the global economy. At the same time, there have been mixed opinions about the role of international tourism in fostering understanding in the world. While some have argued that international tourism can bring people from different cultures together and give them an insight into foreign societies, others have argued that it can create tension and divisiveness as well. 

On one hand, there is no denying the potential tourists have in introducing people from different cultures to one another, allowing them to learn more about each other and eventually create empathy and understanding. Tourists are often encouraged to immerse themselves in foreign cultures, and attend festivals, celebrations or dinners, where they can get to know locals and gain a new perspective on things, while locals can discover the visitors’ homeland simultaneously. Moreover, the business sector of international tourism also provides employment opportunities, financial prosperity and development of infrastructure in the host countries, which can also have a positive impact on intercultural relationships.

On the other hand, it can be argued that international tourism has widened cultural gaps. Tourists’ activities can be seen as offensive and disrespectful to some local communities, as they tend to ignore the unwritten rules and principles of the foreign culture and impose their own lifestyles. Furthermore, international tourism can be blamed for gentrification, with some cultural landmarks or sites being taken over by hospitality industry or leisure sector in order to serve foreign visitors’ interests. In addition, tourists are known to pay high prices for goods and services, while locals are paid low wages as a result, leading to further tensions between the two.

To summarise, it is evident that international tourism has the potential to bridge different cultures through travel and new experiences, but it can also create varying degrees of tension between different cultures. As a result, the benefits and consequences of international tourism should be carefully weighed up to ensure that everyone gets a fair deal, and we can reap the benefits of a more tolerant, understanding and culturally diverse society.
