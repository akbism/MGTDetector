When it comes to sources of knowledge, many people consider books to be the primary source. But the idea that “not everything that is learned is contained in books” cannot be ignored. Indeed, knowledge gained from experience can be just as important and sometimes even more important than knowledge gained from books. 

Both sources of knowledge offer different advantages. For example, knowledge gained from books often provides a broader scope or a more in-depth overview of a given topic. This includes information that one doesn’t have access to through personal experience. Furthermore, the objective nature of books can also be beneficial, as it can provide an unbiased view of a given situation.

On the other hand, knowledge gained through experience is often more gainful due to its personal nature. This type of knowledge extends to a person’s own context, as an individual may be able to draw on their past experiences to better understand a given theory or point. Additionally, this form of information can also be applied in more practical ways, such as being able to find solutions to problems more quickly. 

In my opinion, the best results come when sources of knowledge are combined. Although it may be true that not everything that is learned is contained in books, it definitely is true that not all knowledge can be gained through experience alone. Thus, a successful outcome needs to draw on both types of knowledge. 

Nevertheless, depending on the context, either type of knowledge can be more important. In some cases, such as when one needs to have a comprehensive understanding of a given subject, books are indeed the primary source of knowledge. Meanwhile, when it comes to finding solutions to practical problems, personal experience is often the most important to draw on.

In conclusion, both knowledge gained from books and knowledge gained from experience should be valued, although their importance may vary depending on the context. By combining both sources of knowledge, it is possible to gain a better understanding of a given topic, along with the ability to quickly find solutions to practical problems.
