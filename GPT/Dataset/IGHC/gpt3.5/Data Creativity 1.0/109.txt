The rise of globalization has affected the way citizens from various locations interact with each other worldwide. This has a profound effect on the way popular cities and buildings have developed over time. There have been several changes in the way cities have been visualized and created. Contemporary cities are often seen to have an identical look, resembling one another as a result of globalization.

In previous decades, buildings and cities would often reflect the culture of a specific society that resided in it. Every nation would have its own style of architectural work and artwork, reflecting the various activities and practices of the people living in it. People would identify with the particular region they were living in by looking at the buildings and streets that surrounded them. Moreover, the decorative and structural aspects of the buildings would represent their nationâ€™s culture and beliefs. 

However, this is no longer the case since globalization has compelled large countries to introduce their own cities' designs to many other locations. This has resulted in a homogeneous pattern in the way cities are now built or redeveloped. The shift from establishment of urban aesthetics to economic profitability has prevented many countries from showcasing their cultural heritage in the way their architecture appears. A large number of cities now have a similar look, making it difficult to differentiate between them.

Ultimately, cities have indeed become much more similar as a result of globalization. The fundamental changes in the ethos of multiple countries and the structures they create, reflect the effect of global trends in local customs. Although this has resulted in new innovations and improvements, it has also caused an identity crisis by blurring the line between the traditional and the modern. It has gone too far till the point that cities around the world have almost the same kind of look and feel.
