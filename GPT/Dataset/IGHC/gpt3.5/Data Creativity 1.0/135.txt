Education is a right of every individual in a democratic setup, and governments have the moral responsibility to render it to all. However, it has been argued by some that not only should families not be required to pay taxes that support government schools when they do not send their children there, but their voices should be far from influencing public spending on education. It is certainly true that those who do not benefit from public education, such as those sending their children to a private institution, should not have to pay for it. But mandating such exemption would be damaging to the idea of universal education.

First and foremost, with the exception of families of lesser means, most do have the right to choose between public and private education, depending on their means, and those who choose not to opt for public education save a significant amount rather than having to finance their children’s education. Families in this category thus benefit from public funds being spent on education even if their children are not in public schools.

Moreover, exemption from this tax would deprive the government of revenues that fund a service for people who would otherwise remain deprived, as governments would struggle to find funds for a basic right available for all. This is because the idea of universal education is heavily sustained by public backings, and anyone who opts out of public education does so on one’s own discretion. Besides, the government has invested considerable resources in the formulation of public policies, teacher training and provision of public schools and exclusion of any such individuals would leave the government’s outreach incomplete.

In conclusion, one must understand that the right to choose one’s school has been bestowed in support of individual flexibility and just in case of any struggling family, private education may provide an advantageous path. But it is only right that those who can afford it pay taxes towards the support and upkeep of a universal system of education. And those who cannot afford private education should not miss out on the basic requirement of life, which is well taken care of through public tax contributions.
