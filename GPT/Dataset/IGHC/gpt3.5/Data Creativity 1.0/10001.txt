It is often argued that with the increasing use of computers in education, the role of teachers in classrooms will eventually become obsolete. However, in my opinion, I do not agree with this statement. Though computers can be used to disseminate information and facilitate studying, they cannot replace the role of teachers in classrooms. 

Computers have become an important part of education since they can make access to knowledge easier and give students various interesting avenues to pursue. With the help of computers, students can access information about topics not taught in the curriculum and have the potential to think beyond their textbook knowledge. Computers have been used in the classrooms to facilitate learning, from displaying notes to providing access to different sources of information. These tools facilitate the teachers in improving their teaching methods and helping students learn better, without actually replacing their role. 

Moreover, a major part of a classroom experience is the interaction between the students and the teachers, which is an essential part of the learning process. A teacher’s role is vital in order to explain, elaborate, and guide the students. A teacher is able to assess the class’ capability to comprehend the lesson and use suitable teaching styles based on their observations. Similarly, while discussing topics, they can provide diverse perspectives and help the students think more critically, something which computers can never do. Furthermore, a teacher’s support is invaluable when it comes to helping students face challenges and nurture their passion for learning.

To conclude, I believe that computers can be used to improve teaching methods but cannot completely replace teachers. Though computers and other technology-based resources provide interactive and interesting ways of learning, they cannot substitute the role of a teacher in the classroom due to their inability to interact with students, assess their level of understanding, and provide support.
