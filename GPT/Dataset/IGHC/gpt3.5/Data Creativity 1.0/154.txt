The world has changed a lot since mankind first inhabited it, and this has brought with it some problems unique to our time. In particular, the issue of global inequality is particularly concerning, as nations across the world have vastly different levels of wealth and resources to draw upon. With this in mind, the question of whether it is the responsibility of wealthy nations to share their wealth among poorer countries arises. On the one hand, it is argued that wealthy nations should take it upon themselves to act in a charitable and compassionate manner in order to ensure those who are less well off have the resources needed to survive. On the other hand, some believe it is the responsibility of poorer nations themselves to manage their resources and develop growing economies. 

In my opinion, both of these positions have merit, but wealthy nations should make provisions to assist poorer countries to meet the needs of their citizens, should the resources of the poorer countries alone be insufficient to do so. After all, if it were not for the resources accumulated by these wealthier countries, the world would be a much poorer place. It is therefore not out of a sense of charity, but rather one of interdependence that wealthy nations should share their wealth, particularly in times of famine or crisis. In addition, there is a great need for education to be provided to those in need across the world, to level the playing field and ensure our place in the future. 

At the same time, it is also important to recognize that it is not enough to simply donate money or resources without also building up a sense of independence and responsibility within poorer nations. It is not enough to simply provide food, but to also build up the means to produce it themselves in order to secure their own future. In the same way, it is not enough to simply provide education, but to also build up the means to educate their own citizens, through scholarships and other such initiatives. With this in mind, it is ultimately the responsibility of both wealthy and poorer nations to help each other to achieve greater global harmony and prosperity. 

In conclusion, while I believe wealthy nations should take extra steps to share their wealth with poorer countries, it is essential that these countries also help to build the internal infrastructure of these nations to reduce poverty and create a more equal and secure global future. This can be done through various aid programs, scholarships, and education initiatives, in order for the world to be a better place tomorrow.
