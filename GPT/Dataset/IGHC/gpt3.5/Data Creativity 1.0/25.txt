Nature has blessed us with invaluable resources, but due to the lack of foresight and reckless wanton destruction, the irreplaceable resources are gradually disappearing. One such vital resource is clean water, and its preservation should be of utmost priority.

The benefits of clean water are manifold. It is essential for life and its absence can cause a host of deadly diseases, such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery. Moreover, clean water helps in activities like recreational swimming, fishing and water skiing, allowing children and adults to enjoy nature in its pure form. Not to mention its tremendous importance for agricultural production, energy production, industry and navigation. The list is exhaustive. 

The solution lies in safeguarding our water bodies and conserving this precious resource for future generations. Stringent laws must be implemented to prevent any form of pollution or wastage of clean water. Regulations must be enforced about water usage for industrial or other commercial purposes so that our water supply doesnâ€™t deplete. Chemical runoff from factories should not be allowed to contaminate rivers and lakes. Moreover, public awareness should be created regarding the importance of water conservation and limiting its consumption wherever possible. 

To sum up, clean water is the elixir of life, and its preservation should be made a priority. We need to take preventive measures and spread awareness to ensure that clean water remains available for present and future generations.
