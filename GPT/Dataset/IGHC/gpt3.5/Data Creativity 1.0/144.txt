The population of any country is one of the deciding factors of how much an economy will grow and how healthy will be its environment. Every country has some regulations and policies which are set to control and regulate the population of its citizens. One such regulation states that certain governments may control the number of children a family can have by levying taxes if they wish to have more children. Various governments agree that this is the only way to control population and provide a better quality of life to the citizens of their country, however, there is another opinion about this approach.

It can be argued that by levying taxes on the people who wish to have more children does curb the population to some extent, however, it puts a financial strain on the family and hinders their overall development. This in turns affects the social intelligibility and humanity of the people as a whole. Moreover, it overlooks the other factors that could be stopping people from having a larger family. It does not necessarily mean that people will have more children if it becomes cheaper or easier to have them. People have various other reasons to not have more children and these reasons should be taken into account while making any decision which directly affects the general population.

Furthermore, governments should take other measures to control population such as providing education and introducing family planning methods which are proven to be effective than just implementing a tax. Education empowers people to make more informed choices and gives them better realizations about the consequences of a large family. People should understand the importance of having a family of a reasonable size and it should be the government's goal to educate the population and consequently, control their population.

In conclusion, although certain governments may aim to control its population by levying taxes on those who wish to have more children, this policy is harsh and overlooks various other factors which should be taken into account as well. Governments should opt for educational and family planning programs to better manage the population growth instead.
