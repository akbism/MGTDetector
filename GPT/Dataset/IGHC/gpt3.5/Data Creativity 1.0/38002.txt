In the present age, the news editors play a significant role in what gets broadcast on television and what goes into newspapers. Their decisions can have a dramatic effect on public opinion and trends. It goes without saying that certain factors influence these decisions, such as time constraints, newsworthiness, and audience interests. A news editor must decide which news is significant enough to be reported, giving preference to what is most relevant. On the other hand, there can also be ideological influences that lead to selections of news that reflects a particular political perspective or opinion. 

Whether bad or good, the news must be timely and current to strike a chord with viewers. This ultimately results in a cycle where we become used to consuming mainly bad news. Unsurprisingly, bad news is more sensational in nature and thus grabs more attention. For example, a report on an accident or incident is naturally more riveting than a story of humanitarian work towards combating an issue. This could create a skewed perception of reality among the people, and oftentimes, the most superficially pressing issues are given the most coverage. 

However, it must be said that in recent times, there have been progressive efforts to break away from the usual practice of broadcasting mainly bad news. There have been more experiments with positive and forward-looking stories, and many news outlets have been striving to make a difference in people's lives with their stories. This is definitely a welcome change, as people need inspiring news to remain motivated and look forward with optimism. In that case, it could be argued that more good news should be reported to present a more balanced portrayal of the state of the world. 

In conclusion, news editors must consider numerous factors when deciding what to report on, such as the newsworthiness and audience interests. However, for a more balanced media landscape, there should be concerted efforts to report a more even mix of bad and good news. This can be achieved with experimentation and a proactive approach towards presenting positive news stories.
