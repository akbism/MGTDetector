Intro: 
It is widely accepted that the disparity in wealth between different countries has been increasing at an alarming rate. This is especially particularly evident when we compare developed countries and those of a developing or underdeveloped nature. This has raised the question of whether rich countries should help the poorer ones or will this only lead to a state of dependence? This essay will discuss both sides of the argument before coming to a conclusion. 

Body Paragraphs: 
One argument in support of rich countries helping poorer ones is that it can bring about significant positive change in destitute communities. International aid allows for the distribution of key resources such as food, medicine and technology to those in need. For example, with the help of wealthy nations in the developed world, some African nations that had previously been in poverty stricken states, have made large strides towards economic development. This has in turn created more employment opportunities and better standards of living.  Furthermore, developing nations can find necessary assistance from wealthy countries to not just build their infrastructure but to also develop their social and political structures.

On the other hand, another common argument against rich countries helping the poorer ones is that offering assistance does not directly address the root cause of the problem, i.e. lack of economic and political stability. If assistance is provided but not managed correctly, it can cause a nation to become dependent on aid, which in turn can halt any progress in the long term. While it is true that aid is essential in cases of natural disasters and other relief efforts, relying on this aid over the course of a long period of time can leave a nation unable to innovate, eliminate inefficiencies or maximize resources which in turn can lead to a very limited long term sustainability. 

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, providing support to poorer countries can be beneficial in certain respects, however, it has to be done with great caution as to not create a state of dependency. Wealthier nations have an obligation to provide necessary resources in worst-case scenarios but those in need of aid should also be taught the skills and given access to resources which can make that nation more self-reliant in the long run.
