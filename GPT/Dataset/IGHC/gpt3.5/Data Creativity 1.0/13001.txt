Books and experience are two invaluable sources of knowledge and both have their own unique benefits. People have traditionally relied on books to gain knowledge but experience is gaining more and more focus in recent times. Ultimately, experience is more important source of knowledge, since it offers a deeper understanding and awareness of the learned material while also ensuring that one has hands-on knowledge of living through and adapting to various situations.

Books contain valuable information which can be used as a guide while gaining experience. They are often written by experts in the field and contain critical knowledge which can prove to be useful in many situations. Books provide breadth of knowledge as students can cover greater amounts of information without having to go through the actual experience. They are also a great asset for further research and exploration. 

In comparison, the most valuable knowledge gained from experience often comes from the difficulties that are encountered in any venture. Such troubles canâ€™t be learned from any book, as books often fail to provide contextual information about the situation and how to modify the strategy depending on different individual situations. Emotional intelligence is a good example here, as it involves understanding of the emotions, reactions and responses of others. Also, experience comes with trial and error which allows one to draw on personal mistakes and gain valuable, practical knowledge.

In my opinion, experience is more important source of knowledge. It provides the person with an understanding of not only the theoretical elements of a given issue but also the real-world implications of such knowledge. This is because experience not only provides logical insights but also helps a person to build intuitive understanding which helps one to anticipate and respond to various scenarios in different ways. For example, in the field of healthcare, even though one can have read many books on the subject, the person would not be able to understand the thought and experience process of a patient or a doctor until they accompany him and observe the practice in real life.

In conclusion, experience and books are both valuable sources of knowledge, however, the knowledge gained from experience is more important as it is not only valuable for understanding theoretical concepts but also for practical application. It helps develop logical as well as intuitive understanding of a subject and prepares one to respond in different situations.
