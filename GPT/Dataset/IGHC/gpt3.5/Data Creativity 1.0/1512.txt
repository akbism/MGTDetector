In the world we currently live in, technology has become increasingly necessary; computers are one of the most prevailing inventions to date. We are becoming more and more reliant on computing machines for the performance of several activities, from the most mundane such as processing documents, to the most complex such as controlling planes when they take off and land. While there are definitely undeniable benefits, it is factual that our excessive reliance on computers is creating a lack of human interaction and making us more vulnerable to security threats.

Firstly, by utilizing computers to acquire and disseminate information, humans limit their contact with other people and consequently, are unable to develop social skills and interpersonal harmony. This can be seen most evidently in the increasing trend of gambling online and the recent development in online education. Instead of having to go to a physical casino or a university, people are more and more choosing to befriend the virtual world. As a result, the majority of individuals are not being exposed to the necessary social contact in order to have fruitful relationships with others. 

Moreover, as computers and the internet have becoe so pervasive, security threats have rapidly expanded. Hackers can access and exploit confidential information or vital personnel data on computers and networks, and this can cause harm to both individuals and organisations. Take, for example, a cyber-attack against a secure government site: the hackers could affect not only the data stored on the computers but also cause disruption to the service, with significant losses to the affected country. Therefore, overreliance on technology in the ways of communication and assurance is creating additional security problems that need to be addressed.

To summarise, relying too heavily on computers to do mundane tasks or complex activities, is creating a lack of social contact and making people more vulnerable to security issues. Therefore, an appropriate use of technology and a control on reliance is a necessary step towards tackling the security problems. And, rather than substituting human interaction with computing machines, humans should seek to utilize the advantages they offer while minimising the downsides.
