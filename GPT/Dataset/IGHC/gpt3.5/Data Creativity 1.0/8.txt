In recent years, there has been a lot of debate about whether students who stay in school and go on to attend university get less benefit and contribute less than those who travel or take up a job before pursuing higher education. While I understand the potential benefits that could be gained from the latter, I strongly disagree with this statement. 

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that many students have no choice but to stay in school and attend university, given their financial limitations. For these students, getting an education is their only path towards achieving their full potential. If they are able to do well, they are likely to gain a lot of transferable skills, such as communication and problem-solving, and deepen their understanding of certain fields of study. Moreover, they are likely to have skills and qualifications that are highly sought after by employers. 

On the other hand, there is no denying that those who travel or take up a job before pursuing higher education may provide an employer with some valuable skills and experiences; for example, working with different cultures, having an understanding of different markets, and utilizing resources in an effective manner. However, students who attend university are still likely to possess many of these skills, albeit in a more theoretical context. For example, a student who studied international business may be comfortable working for a multinational company with exposure to different cultures and processes. 

Ultimately, both types of students can contribute a great deal to employers. Those with a degree can possess the necessary qualifications and the theoretical knowledge acquired from their studies, while those who have traveled or gained experience first can bring the practical skills honed in the workplace. In my opinion, neither should be viewed as benefiting less than the other, as both have so much to offer.
