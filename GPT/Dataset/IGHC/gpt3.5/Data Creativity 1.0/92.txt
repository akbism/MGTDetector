Drugs have become a part of all modern societies and the use of them, especially amongst the younger population, has continually grown in the face of ever progressing technology and social changes. Recent studies have revealed that the experimentation with legal and illegal drugs is beginning at an earlier age than ever before and this has sparked debates over the responsibility of social figures such as parents, who are often seen as setting bad examples. Therefore, it is important to discuss the main causes behind this and the effects of widespread drug use by young people in order to better combat the issue.

Firstly, there are various underlying factors as to why drug use is occurring on a larger scale and at an earlier age in today’s society. One is economic stress. Many young people are coming of age in a society rife with financial insecurity and uncertain job prospects, leading to feelings of anxiety and depression which can, in turn, be soothed by substance abuse. Likewise, another cause could be the lack of education available to young people about drugs. Without proper knowledge of the negative effects drugs can have, people may be more likely to use them for experimentation. Moreover, the change in the example set by adults to children is cited as a major cause for the increase in drug use. The easy access to narcotics, coupled with a more tolerant attitude to recreational drug use from adults, has led a growing number of young people to indulge in this activity.

Regarding the effects of wide-ranging drug use by young people, one of the most prominent is damage to both mental and physical health. Excessive drug intake leads to much higher risks of addiction, as well as physical problems such as seizures, breathing difficulties, and even death. Cognitive health can also suffer greatly, seen with memory loss, intellectual deterioration, and an inability to concentrate. Because drugs can bring short-term relief in difficult situations, young people often don’t consider the long-term implications of their actions until it’s too late. Furthermore, with such easy access to illegal drugs, they will also be more exposed to a risky criminal world and may even begin trafficking their own drugs, leading to a potential rupture of family ties. 

In terms of steps to combat the widespread use of drugs by young people, public education campaigns are essential in providing awareness about the true consequences of using drugs. Schools and universities should also make it a priority to inform teenagers and young adults about the health risks that come with drug use. It is also important to accept the fact that the cycle of drug use could take generations to break and that simply punishing the use of drugs may not be enough. We must provide alternative ways to channel their minds and energies, such as sporting activities and art classes. Moreover, parents should make more of an effort to set better examples, and thereby help in reducing the number of young people experimenting with drugs.

To sum up, the implications of drug use by young people can be greatly damaging to both themselves and society. While some of the causes may be hard to change, such as economic insecurity, providing awareness about drugs and setting a better example can help to break the cycle of drug use and help those previously affected by it.
