Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is one of the oldest and most controversial punishments used in the criminal justice system today. It is reserved for serious offenses such as murder, rape, and treason, and is intended to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals. The debate around this sentence tends to centre around its efficacy and morality, and whether or not it should be abolished completely. 

Some people argue that without capital punishment, our lives are less secure as crimes of violence increase without the deterrent. These people argue that capital punishment is necessary in order to keep the level of violence in society under control. 

However, I disagree with this opinion. There is a lack of evidence to suggest that the use of capital punishment has any direct effect on crime levels in the long term. It tends to be a particularly emotive issue and its deterring effects are highly contested. Furthermore, capital punishment does not address the root causes of crime, such as poverty, economic inequality, and lack of education and opportunity for people living in marginalized or disadvantaged communities. 

It is also important to consider the ethical aspects of capital punishment, especially as there have been a number of cases where innocent people have been wrongly convicted and executed. For these reasons, it is difficult to argue that our lives are less secure without capital punishment, and that it is essential to control violence in society. 

In conclusion, while some people advocate the use of capital punishment to control violence in society, I believe that it is not an effective way to do this, and brings with it its own ethical considerations. Our lives may not be less secure without it, and more attention should be given to addressing the underlying causes of crime.
