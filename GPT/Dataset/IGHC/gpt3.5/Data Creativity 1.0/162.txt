Every individual on the planet is born with a set of predetermined characteristics, both physical and psychological, which will form the basis of his or her personality and development. From the onset, these innate characteristics can play a major role in shaping who we become as adults, and how our lives unfold over the course of time. However, it is also true that our life experiences can have further influence on our personalities, decisions and overall life journey. Taking this into consideration, I believe that the characteristics we are born with are the most major contributing factor to our development and growth as individuals.

To begin with, genes and biological factors are a fundamental part in forming our personalities and behavior, as they act like a sealed-off code which represents who we already are. Our abilities in terms of intellectual capacity,learning, physical features and our predilection towards certain behaviors are all majorly determined at birthâ€“ before our life has even started. This code may also predispose us to a variety of personal and/or physical limitations, although we will still have great possibilities for success in our lives, as this code can also provide us with great gifts and positive capabilities.

On the contrary, it is not simply our biological characteristics that are determined from the start. Our environment, both in utero and of course in our homes, can also side in strongly with regard to our life experiences. Children living in supportive and encouraging environments have the opportunity to grow in positive ways, and have far better fields of opportunity for their development. Equally however, children brought up in harsh, discouraging or abusive familial environments are not granted the same outlooks and must battle to break away from the programmed behaviors that they may come to accept.

In conclusion, while there is no denying the influence that our environment and experiences can have on our development, it is my view that the fundamental characteristics that come to shape our lives and personalities are most heavily dependent on our genetics. These are the building blocks of who we are and how we grow, and despite our efforts, these mechanics cannot be changed or adapted to fit the life we so desire.
