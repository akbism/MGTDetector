Education remains one of the most powerful tools in a person's life and its value cannot be overstated. It opens multiple paths and helps a person to pursue their vocation of choice. The ultimate aim is to inculcate knowledge in a studentâ€™s mind, along with skills and wisdom to hone their personality and intellect. Although, education can bring out the best in people and can be the gateway to success, its value is slowly losing its importance. 

Firstly, with the advent of the internet access to information is no longer limited to educational institutions. People can read content available on the internet, attend webinars, watch tutorials, and find solutions to problems with the help of experts available online. Free-learning platforms are now available, enabling people to acquire knowledge and skills at their own adapted pace and without any cost, unlike educational courses. Consequently, the need for traditional educational methods of teaching and learning has reduced significantly. 

Secondly, due to globalization and the rapid automation of many industries, the world has become increasingly inter-connected leading to the emergence of new job sectors with unique requirements. The traditional educational structure is not in-sync with the new job market and its requirements. In a situation like this, theoretical knowledge at all levels of education,, cannot assure security of a job. Therefore, even with high qualifications, people often struggle to find a job as employers look for candidates with specific technical, industrial, or language skills that can only be self-learned or acquired through specialized training. 

To conclude, although education holds enormous benefits and helps a person build a successful career, its value is slowly losing relevance due to the internet and changes in the job-market. Therefore, it becomes crucial that people take up independent learning and specialized courses to improve their chances in the job market. Such practices need to be encouraged from a young age in order to ensure promising career prospects and a successful life.
