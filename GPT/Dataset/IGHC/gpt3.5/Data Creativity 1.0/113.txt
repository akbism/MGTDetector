The idea that food has become easier to prepare is arguably improving our lives in today's society. This change has enabled us to ultimately save time and energy while enjoying a greater range of cuisines and flavors. It is also indisputable that this has enabled an increase in the diversity of dietary options that people can have access to. 

To start with, people are now able to prepare meals a lot faster, using convenient, ready-made ingredients. For instance, many supermarkets now offer pre-cut fruit, pre-made sauces and ready-made meal kits. These, when combined together, can make it exponentially quicker to make a tasty and nutritious meal. This has enabled people with busy lifestyles the chance to have hot homemade meals more frequently and not resort to unhealthy options like takeaway food.

Furthermore, with the prevalence of more convenience-based food offerings, it has enabled people to explore wider array of flavors as well. Many supermarkets now offer a wide range of ethnic food. This has enabled people to deepen their understanding and appreciation for international cuisines and traditions. This option is beneficial for both people who are looking for something new to try and people who cannot access the traditional ingredients needed to prepare certain dishes that are staple in their own culture. 

In conclusion, I believe that the changes made in how food is prepared has certainly improved the way people live. Not only people have access to meals that can be prepared relatively quickly, but also they have access to a wide range of culinary options. As such, they can be more mindful and experimental when it comes to their diet as well as having access to enjoyable, nutritious meals more often.
