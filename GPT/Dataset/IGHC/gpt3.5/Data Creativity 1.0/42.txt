Advertising has become an integral part of our lives, it is all around us. On one hand, some people consider it as an important part of their lives, because it serves a great purpose of introducing products and services to them and providing valuable information, such as health awareness campaigns. Consequently, it helps people to make a right decision when it comes to new products and services. Advertising also creates jobs and provides business opportunities, which is significant in today's tough financial climate. 

On the other hand, there are those who believe that advertising has negative effects on our life. It creates a false impression of the products and makes people buy more than what they may need. With more and more advertisements, it leads to more materialistic society, where people have more focus on money and fame. Also, aggressive advertising is often seen, such as using sexual content to attract people. Therefore, it affects particularly vulnerable groups such as children, who then think that it is completely normal to have everything around them and be obsessed with luxury.

In my opinion, I would say that advertising has both positive and negative impacts on our lives. I believe that the negative effects of advertising can be addressed by the proper regulation by the government, in terms of approving and controlling the advertisements that should be displayed to the public. This should also be taken into consideration when it comes to targeting the right audience. Furthermore, it is also important to teach people how to differentiate advertising from real-life and help people to form personal opinion instead of blindly accept everything they see. 

To conclude, I think that having advertising as a part of our life can be beneficial if it is properly regulated and managed, in order to ensure that it has only positive and effective effects on us.
