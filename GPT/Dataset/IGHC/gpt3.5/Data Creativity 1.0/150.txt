The pervasive presence of computers has indeed been making an impact on education. As technology continues to evolve, some people argue that computers are becoming a precursor to obsolete the role of the teacher in the classroom. From this perspective, it appears that the roles of teachers are no longer necessary. In this essay, I will discuss why computers do not replace teachers, and why their essential role will remain unchanged.

First and foremost, computers are incapable of inspiring, motivating and sustaining the enthusiasm of students in a learning environment. Computers are designed to find patterns and correct mistakes but not to understand it. It is the teacher who is able to create that kind of learning environment. Additionally, Computers cannot create an invigorating atmosphere for the students with their enthusiasm for the subject and impart knowledge.

Furthermore, computers are not capable of assessing the in depth understanding and knowledge of a student. The role of a teacher is to ascertain the level of understanding of the student and be their guide, mentor and facilitator of learning. A computer cannot do this. Assessing progress of individual students also depends upon the teacher's ability to recognize the need for improvement, and this cannot be obtained from a program that delivers pre-determined materials.

Finally, a teacher acts as an important support system for students in the classroom. A teacher can provide the proper guidance and support that the students need to further their development, help them overcome any obstacles that come their way and ensure their success in the long run. This is something a computer cannot do.

In conclusion, computers are indeed playing an increasingly vital role in modern education but they do not have the potential to fully replace the role of teachers in the classroom. Therefore, the role of a teacher will remain the same, and this is something that cannot be taken away from them.
