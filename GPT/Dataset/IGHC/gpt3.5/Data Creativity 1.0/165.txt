The city where I grew up, located in eastern India, is my hometown, and I’m proud to be a resident. While I can think of many things that I would like to change about the place, if I could make one major change, I would improve the public transport and infrastructure. 

Public transport is a crucial part of any city’s infrastructure. It not only provides convenience to residents, but also helps ease the burden of traffic congestion. Unfortunately, in my hometown, the situation is far from ideal. The city currently has a few low-quality buses that provide poor service. Additionally, a majority of them are in disrepair. This has resulted in a lack of efficient and reliable public transport. Furthermore, the authorities have failed to provide any alternatives, such as a metro system, that could address this problem.

Moreover, the city infrastructure has not kept pace with its rapid growth in population. This has resulted in increased traffic and air pollution, making the local environment unhealthy. There are few public parks, which is a direct result of poor infrastructure, and makes the place look dull and unattractive. 

Therefore, if I could make one major change to my hometown, it would be to improve the public transport system and infrastructure. By investing in efficient and reliable public transport, like a metro system, the authorities can ensure a smooth flow of traffic. Additionally, they can create green spaces and recreational facilities to improve the overall look and feel of the city. This could attract more tourists and businesses, and help uplift the economy of the city, which will in turn benefit the citizens living in it. 

In conclusion, if I were given the opportunity to change one major thing about my hometown, I would choose to improve the public transport and infrastructure. This single change would have a positive impact on the local economy, environment, and quality of life of the citizens.
