India being such a richly diverse nation has some unique customs that are unique to its culture and traditions. Out of these I would love to share one such treasured custom from my country. It is the custom of greeting each other with the words Namaste. 

Namaste is a traditional form of greeting in India. It has its origin in Sanskrit language, which is more about 3000 years ago. It when translated into English means ‘the divine in me bows to the divine in you’. In India, it is a gesture to show respect and reverence towards each other, without any discrimination of caste, creed, race, or religion. Since it is done with folded hands and bowed head, it conveys a sense of humility.

The reason I choose this custom to be adopted by people in other countries is due to the deep moral and spiritual greeting it conveys. It implies that everyone is equal, no matter what religion, sect or race they belong to. It is all about respecting each other, despite their differences. In a world that is struggling with hatred, intolerance, and divisiveness, such a gesture would be a big step towards peace and acceptance. 

In my opinion, Namaste is much more than just a greeting. It represents India's philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ which translates to ‘the world is one family’. In addition, greeting someone with folded hands is a way of accepting them and it conveys positive energy. I feel like it's the perfect way of exchanging pleasantries and it could help in fostering better relationships both at personal and professional levels.

I hope that people from other countries would adopt the custom of Namaste and make it a part of their daily lives. By doing this, we can learn to respect each other and together, create a peaceful and harmonious world.
