Competition is the inherent driving force of human progress and development. It is no wonder therefore that parents, teachers, and society in general over the years have encouraged children to indulge in healthy competition. Some people argue that this helps to ensure that these children will become successful adults, while others contend that cooperation is more beneficial. In my opinion, a right balance of both is important to ensure the holistic growth and development of a child.

To begin with, it is undeniable that competitiveness can be beneficial to children in their formative years. The spirit of competition in young minds helps instill a sense of discipline, determination, and a drive to constantly improve and achieve more. This ensures that these children grow up to become successful individuals who strive to be better and follow their passion with initiative. Competition also provides an opportunity to learn from mistakes, and make use of them as lessons to improve the next performance. Moreover, it helps children to develop essential skills such as how to stay focused, think positively, and be mentally alert.

On the other hand, it is equally vital for a child to learn that working in a team or lending a helping hand to other can be equally rewarding. At a young age, cooperation helps children to better understand the concept of shared responsibility and respect for the individual capabilities of peers. This teaches children the importance of relationships, loyalty, and moral values that are essential for their social growth. Furthermore, they learn the value of individual and collective success, which is paramount in being a successful member of society. 

In conclusion, while competitiveness is certainly beneficial to a child's development, it is equally important to encourage cooperation among children as well. It is important to strike a balance between the two to ensure holistic growth and success in the future. Only when children learn the value of both of these approaches will they become useful, productive and successful adults in the long run.
