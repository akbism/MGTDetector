Nowadays, people are increasingly moving away from rural areas and settling down in urban cities; it has been an ongoing debate over the past few decades whether it is better to let children grow up in the countryside or in the city. While some believe that the city life has more to offer in terms of social activities and job opportunities, I firmly believe that countryside living is more beneficial for children growing up, as it provides better air quality, improves mental health and fosters stronger family relationships. 

Firstly, it is essential for children’s well-being to have access to fresh air and greenspaces. Several studies have shown that children who grow up around greenery display lower mortality rates, increased physical health and improved mental wellbeing. Unfortunately, cities with their increasing population struggle to provide these benefits. In the Countryside, there tends to be an abundance of gardens, parks, countryside and forests -all of which play a vital role in a child’s emotional and psychological development. While cities will always provide a few green spaces, it is impossible to come close to a natural environment that the countryside offers our little ones. 

Additionally, the pace of life in urban cities is incredibly fast. Working parents tend to place considerable pressure on their child to have part-time jobs or to excel academically. As a result, children have very less time for physical activities, which can lead to a variety of physical and mental health issues. On the other hand, in a countryside, children tend to have more opportunities to relax, have time with family, engage in more physical activities and appreciate the simpler things in life. Hence, the countryside can play a paramount role in allowing children to remain care-free and develop into individuals who are confidant in themselves and content with their life. 

Moreover, when children grow up in the countryside, there tends to be stronger family connection. The environment of a countryside forces family members to actively support each other and bond. As a result, children are able to learn the essential values of being part of a family and are instilled with crucial life skills that will allow them to succeed in the future. However, due to the time constraints of working parents in urban cities, this family bond is often neglected as they are unable to spend enough time together. 

To conclude, I believe rural living is highly beneficial for children’s wellbeing and future success. While the city life has some advantages, countryside living is more advantageous as it offers access to fresh air and greenery, improves physical and mental health and allows for stronger family relationships.
