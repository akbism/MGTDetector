Education is an unrivalled asset for the all-round development of a child. Whether the education should be imparted at home or school is a debatable topic, taking numerous aspects into consideration. From the perspective of a child, education at home may hamper the cognitive development, because of the lack of peers leading to missing out on the chance for social and emotional development. Therefore, imparting education in schools is the best choice.

However, due to the advancements in technology, homeschooling has recently become a viable option for many parents. Parents can find and access quality instruction materials online and have the comfort of monitoring their children’s progress during learning. Also, homeschooling provides the opportunity of personalized learning by adjusting to the learning pace of the child.

On the other hand, while homeschooling gives parents direct control over their children’s learning, children require outside encounters to flexibly think and adjust in a multi-cultural society. Perhaps, the best way to ensure this is by sending them to school.

To conclude, while homeschooling provides better control over what is being taught and the learnings absorbed, the well-rounded development of a child necessitates that education must be imparted at schools. Moreover, only schools can create an environment for the physical, psychological and social development of children. Therefore, in addition to good parents’ support, education in schools is essential for a balanced life for our future generations.
