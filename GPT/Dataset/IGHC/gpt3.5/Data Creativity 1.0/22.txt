Environmental unrest is one of the most pressing issues facing the world today and it is a problem that is too big to be managed by individual countries alone. The drastic changes in the global climate, the extinction of species, and the growing pollution are all symptoms of a systemic issue that requires international solutions. In order to prevent further devastation to the planet, governments and leaders around the world must cooperate and collaborate in order to effectively tackle the issue. 

There are numerous actions that can be taken to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as reducing reliance on carbon-intensive sources of energy and encouraging sustainable practices, like reforestation and conservation. However, for these initiatives to be successful, global cooperation is essential, as there are many countries that remain part of the problem. For example, some nations are unwilling to comply with emissions targets due to the economic costs of modernization, while others refuse to diminish their production of carbon-rich resources. Therefore, it is necessary for international efforts to be taken in order to favorably influence states in order to reach a beneficial outcome for the entire planet.

Moreover, global bodies, such as the United Nations, have played a significant role in creating protocols and solutions related to the environment. International organizations are better equipped than individual nations to evaluate the effects of climate change because they can access a vast amount of data, as well as resources to compile reports and accurately measure the current state of the environment. Through the analysis of this data, governments can identify solutions and implement policies that will help to protect the planet.

In conclusion, due to the scope and magnitude of environmental issues, single countries or individuals are unable to keep up with the potential damage that could be caused. Therefore, it is essential that global solutions are found in order to effectively address the issue of climate change. International cooperation is essential in order to ensure that policies are favorable worldwide, and to take data-driven decisions that can lead to more ambitious projects that protect the environment against further harm.
