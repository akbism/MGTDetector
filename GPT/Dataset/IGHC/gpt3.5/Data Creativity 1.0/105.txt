Establishing a new University in the community is an idea that has been met with divided opinions. While some consider this an excellent opportunity to benefit from the universityâ€™s infrastructure, studies and research, others oppose the idea citing potential drawbacks such as furthering of environmental pollution and overcrowding of the area. 

To begin with, university in the community will be a boon to the progress of the area. Adequate job opportunities will be created for people willing to work in the area and the availability of manpower will boost local businesses. Also, the campus of the university can offer students a variety of activities outside their academic curriculum such as sports, music and literature. This will help young minds to develop a range of skills and hone their individual abilities. 

On the other hand, a university anywhere has the potential to create traffic problems and environmental damage. The addition of the university, hosting thousands of students and staff, can lead to overcrowding and congestion of roads. Moreover, a large number of construction will be necessary that may cause damage to the existing plants and vegetation in the area. Moreover, increased flow of traffic will further lead to air and noise pollution. 

To conclude, establishing a university in the community is a gigantic task that needs to be done carefully. While the immediate economic benefit to the community cannot be simply overlooked, the authorities need to keep in mind the potential drawbacks and take appropriate mitigation steps. Foremost of them remains strict enforcement of house rules, a mass public transportation system, efficient garbage management and such. 

In conclusion, establishing a new university in the community comes with both advantages and disadvantages.  Before embarking upon the project, it is important for the authorities to consider and mitigate the potential risks before benefits can be reaped from the project.
