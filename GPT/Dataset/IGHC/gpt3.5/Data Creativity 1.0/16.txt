School dropouts are a growing phenomenon that is practiced around the world. In the United States of America, reports suggest that nearly 82% of the high school freshman students complete their high school education but the remaining 18% fail to finish their high school education, resulting in an increased dropout rate. This issue is a concern for many parents, teachers, and educational administrators alike. To better understand this issue, one must analyze the various reasons behind why students drop out, what societal and economic effects it has and finally explore different approaches to solving this problem.

The primary and most important reason why students fail to complete their schooling is due to personal issues such as family problems and economic disability. In many cases, students are unable to graduate due to lack of parental support or financial means to pay for their tuition or to buy the required resources for their education. In addition to this, there are other problems such as bullying, peer pressure and emotional issues that lead to students dispensing from their studies. Moreover, some students have to survive on jobs, while continuing their education, which makes it even more difficult for them to balance both work and studies.

The implications of student dropsouts are high and can affect their personal and professional life. As dropouts miss out on the qualifications one gets after completion of their study, they are unable to benefit from the various opportunities available to educated people. Lack of educational qualifications means that they also can’t get jobs easily in professional sectors. They risk falling into poverty and resort to menial jobs that can’t provide them a better future. Dropouts can also become more prone to health disorders such as early deaths, teenage pregnancy and drug and alcohol abuse. 

The issue of school dropouts can be addressed through different approaches such as introducing financial incentives, establishing a friendly learning environment in all educational institutes, providing better resources and healthcare to both students and their families, emphasizing the importance of education, and creating employment opportunities for the dropouts. Financial incentivization can be a great way to motivate students from lower economic backgrounds to further their education. Government can make such programs such as initiatives, scholarships and loans to help these students. Moreover, it is important that every educational institution teaches in a friendly environment, so that students feel free to approach their teachers for help. Furthermore, Government should create more employment opportunities for those who can’t continue their studies but wish to earn their living. 

To conclude, school dropouts are a serious problem in our society and can have lasting effects on a person’s life. Therefore, it is important to make more people aware of this issue, while also taking certain measures such as providing financial incentives, establishing a friendly learning environment and creating employment opportunities. If such progress is made, the dropout rate of our society can be reduced significantly.
