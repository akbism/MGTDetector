Climate change has become one of the most significant challenges of the present times. With an increased number of erratic weather patterns, rise in global average temperature, long periods of droughts, and heat waves, it has become highly essential to understand how humans are contributing to the current condition and what counter measures we should take to prevent further damage.

Governments around the world have come up with various plans, initiatives and resources to limit the amount of destruction caused due to climate change. However, as it stands, it can be said that it is not necessarily within their jurisdiction to completely tackle this global problem. They certainly can play an active role in controlling and managing the climate from deteriorating more, but ultimately, it is the responsibility of an individual to make the necessary changes to induce a positive effect on environment.

There are a few possibilities to implement solutions at individual level. To begin with, effective implementation of recycling for solid and liquid wastes should be directed. This will help in reducing the amount of dangerous toxins in the air and water. Furthermore, use of public transport should be to encouraged over private vehicles as this will decrease the level of carbon emissions significantly. Adoption of energy efficient habits like switching off lights and other appliances when they are not in use, might not seem like a major impact, yet it would add to the overall benefits.

To conclude, the onus of tracking the effects of climate change lies with the governments, but in terms of combating it, it is the individual's responsibility to take steps to begin with. It is essential to understand that it and only together, through collective efforts we would be able to make significant progress in this regard.
