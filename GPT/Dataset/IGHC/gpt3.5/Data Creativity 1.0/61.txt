It is a fact that children should be taught to help with household tasks as contributing to the house is part of every person’s duties. But, whether they should be required to assist with these tasks at a young age needs to be debated. In my opinion, I feel that children should be encouraged to help, instead of forcing them to do so.

To begin with, engaging children in chores such as doing the dishes, sorting laundry, dusting and cleaning can teach them valuable life skills like organization, delegation and responsibility. It also teaches them discipline and renders them independent and capable. Similarly, it helps them learn to set goals, manage their time, and also understand consequences for their actions. But, forcing them to work, even if it is good for them, can make them resentful of the responsibility and can strain family relationships. For example, when a child is overloaded by too many tasks it can leave them feeling overwhelmed and frazzled, similar to how an adult can feel when they’ve overcommitted themselves. 

Another fundamental factor that needs to be taken into consideration, is the child’s health. Allowing the little one to be a part of all the household activities is great, but their limits should be defined. A child should not be expected to take up more than they can handle, as this could be harmful to him. Many kids are in various extracurricular activities, and setting limits will help them balance their downtime and chores efficiently. Similarly, very young children that are too small to help around the house should not be made to feel guilty for not being able to do any chores. 

In summary, I agree that children should indeed be taught to help around the house, and be held accountable for the same, but it should be encouraged instead of being enforced. It is important to bear in mind the age, physical development, and abilities of each child when assigning household tasks, so that the same don’t become an undue burden. Children should be allowed to understand that it is indeed their duty, and that it is a way of expressing their love for their family.
