The mass media undoubtedly has a profound effect on the formation of public opinion. Television, radio and newspapers are some of the familiar forms of mass media that can not only give information but also shape the thoughts of any person who is exposed to it. Although mass media plays an essential role in influencing the thinking of individuals, it is also important to understand that it is only one of the factors that have an influence on people’s beliefs.

The extent to which mass media can impact people’s ideas depends largely on the person’s receptivity to the messages being transmitted. While some can immerse themselves in the contents shared by these platforms, the opinion of some can be easily swayed by the propaganda presented within the medium. The ability of the media to influence one’s thoughts is not only impacted by their original beliefs but also by their inclination to consume and observe the coverage.

Moreover, in today’s digital age, information is more accessible than ever before. Online presence of newspapers and media outlets are discussed and propagated across several other platforms. This has allowed opinions to be formulated in a more dynamic and varied manner. Even without being directly exposed to the traditional mass media, individuals are open to a variety of sources that could alter their perspectives.

In conclusion, the media clearly has a massive part to play in how people think and can be a prominent tool in moulding public opinion. However, it cannot be said that it is the sole element in the creation of one’s opinions and beliefs. Other aspects, such as interactions with the people around them and independent research will also have an effect in determining their perspective on certain matters.
