Technology has rapidly developed over the years, enabling us to stay connected, communicate with people around the world, and access a vast amount of information on the internet. As such, there is no doubt that computers play an indispensable role in our lives, particularly for children. Admittedly, using a computer every day can have both positive and negative effects on children, but I firmly believe that the positive outweighs the negative, thus I disagree with the statement that more negative than positive effects occur. 

Firstly, computers can help children improve their cognitive ability, as computer based activities come with certain challenges and decisions that can boost logical abilities. For example, playing puzzles and simple video games can help children recognize patterns and think strategically. Additionally, computers can also be used to increase overall knowledge, especially in regards to educational materials such as books, notes, and multimedia clips. For instance, websites such as Khan Academy have detailed lesson plans that can help children better understand a topic and give them efficient resources to study with. Furthermore, having access to the internet can also provide children with opportunities to interact with other children from distant locations, and through this, broaden their outlook and learn about different cultures. 

However, there is a common fear that allowing children to use computers everyday can be detrimental. Such concerns stem from the fact that it may lead to children spending too much time in front of their computers and negatively affecting their physical health. This is especially the case with too much gaming or spending excessive time on social media, as it can lead to a lack of coordination and even depression. In addition, children may also be exposed to inappropriate content online if they are not supervised.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that computers can have both positive and negative effects on children, but I am of the opinion that the positive outweighs the negative. Therefore, as long as they are used in moderation and under appropriate supervision, computers can be beneficial to shape a childâ€™s development.
