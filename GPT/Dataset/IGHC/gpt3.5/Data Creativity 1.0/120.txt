The experience of a ‘holiday’ can vary greatly depending on the person and what they are looking to get out of it. For some, a holiday is a chance to relax, unwind and get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. For others, a holiday is an opportunity to explore, experience something new and take on exciting challenges. The travel industry has certainly noticed this changing trend, with more people favouring holidays with activities, challenges and a sense of adventure instead of the iconic traditional leisurely beach break.

The traditional holiday might still have its charm, however, as technology advances and accessibility to travel increases, so does our curiosity and desire to push ourselves to experience something new. People are now willing to challenge themselves outside of their comfort zones, which is reflected in their holiday choices. Activities such as trekking, mountain climbing and white-water rafting are becoming increasingly popular, as well as holidays that take on an educational path, where tourism activities are combined with cultural and historical knowledge.

Given the current health and ecological crisis, there is also a rise in more sustainable travel experiences such as farm stays, eco-tourism and working holidays. Whilst traditional holidays can provide a chance for people to take a break and undo stress, often these holidays can be fleeting and offer little lasting memories to take away with us. Challenging holiday activities offer people the chance to learn, develop and push themselves to achieve something they may not be able to do in their day-to-day life.

In conclusion, I agree that the nature of the average ‘holiday’ is changing as people are seeking increasingly challenging and rewarding experiences. As opposed to traditional holidays, these activities offer something special and can provide long-lasting and meaningful memories.
