My preference when it comes to activities is to take risks and try new things. I firmly believe there is much to be gained by taking calculated risks and trying new activities that come out of an individual’s comfort zone. There are many positive benefits to taking risks and trying new things, including personal growth, expanding one’s horizons, and acquiring problem-solving skills. 

When taking risks and trying new things, an individual experiences personal growth, as they can gain a better understanding of themselves. For instance, I tried rock-climbing last summer, something I had never done before. During this experience, I learned more about my physical and mental capacity as I improved my climbing skills and pushed my body to do things I hadn’t ever done before. I also learned more about myself as I faced challenges, found solutions, and felt a great sense of accomplishment after completing a hard climb. 

Risk-taking and trying something new also allows one to expand their horizons. I have taken numerous trips to countries I had never visited before, and these trips opened my eyes to the world in so many ways. I encountered different cultures, customs, and perspectives I never knew existed, and I was able to gain a better understanding of the world around me and the people who inhabit it. 

Lastly, taking risks and trying something new teaches problem-solving skills. For example, when I began cooking two years ago, I encountered many challenges, such as learning how to properly use kitchen utensils and understanding cooking techniques. While it was difficult at first, I was able to use trial and error to understand how to persist through my difficulties, and I now consider myself a fairly proficient cook. 

All in all, it can be very beneficial to take risks and try new activities. While it can be scary to step outside an individual’s comfort zone, it can lead to tremendous growth and development, an expansion of one’s world view, and the acquisition of useful problem-solving skills. For these reasons, I believe that taking risks and trying something new is the best approach to life.
