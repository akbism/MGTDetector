Language is an important part of culture and identity. It is often said that “a language is a dialect with an army and a navy”. In this context, having a single international official language has been a topic of debate for many years. On the one hand, some people argue that having a single language would make communication easier and improve international understanding. On the other hand, some people argue that having a single language would cause a loss of culture and make it difficult to identify countries. 

In my opinion, having a single international official language would be beneficial in many ways. Firstly, it would make communication easier and help people from different countries to understand each other. This would lead to improved international understanding and cooperation. Secondly, it would help to reduce the language barrier between countries, which would make it easier for people to travel, do business, and interact with people from different countries. 

However, I do not believe that having a single language would cause a loss of culture. In fact, it would give people the opportunity to learn and understand different cultures. For example, people from different countries could learn about each other’s cultures and traditions by learning the same language. This would help to promote cultural exchange and understanding. Furthermore, a single language would not make it difficult to identify countries as countries would still have their own languages and cultures. 

In conclusion, I believe that having a single international official language would be beneficial in many ways. It would make communication easier and help to reduce the language barrier between countries. Furthermore, it would not cause a loss of culture, but rather give people the opportunity to learn and understand different cultures.
