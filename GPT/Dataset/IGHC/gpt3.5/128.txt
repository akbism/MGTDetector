The idea that companies should encourage their employees who work in high positions to leave at the age of 55 has been a topic of much debate. On one hand, it is argued that this would give opportunities to the new generation and allow them to progress in their careers. On the other hand, it is argued that this would lead to a loss of valuable experience and knowledge. In my opinion, I believe that companies should be encouraged to create a balance between the two, rather than forcing employees to leave at a certain age.

Firstly, it is essential to note that there is a lot of value in having experienced employees in the workplace, particularly in high positions. These employees have a deep understanding of the workplace, the industry and the company itself. This is something that cannot be replaced by younger generations, regardless of how much potential they may have. Therefore, it is important to recognize the importance of these experienced employees and allow them to stay in their positions for as long as they are able.

Secondly, as much as it is important to recognize the value of experienced employees, it is also essential to provide opportunities to the new generation. This is why I believe that companies should look to create a balance between the two, rather than forcing employees to leave at a certain age. For example, companies could introduce a policy which allows experienced employees to stay in their positions for a certain period of time, while also encouraging them to mentor the younger generation and pass on their knowledge and experience. This would allow the new generation to benefit from the experience of the older generation, while also allowing them to progress in their careers.

In conclusion, while I agree that companies should look to provide opportunities to the new generation, I do not believe that this should be done at the expense of experienced employees. Instead, companies should look to create a balance between the two, by allowing experienced employees to stay in their positions for a certain period of time, while also encouraging them to mentor the younger generation. This would allow the new generation to benefit from the experience of the older generation, while also allowing them to progress in their careers.
