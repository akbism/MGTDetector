Violence is a major issue in the modern world and its presence in the media has been a major point of discussion for many years. There are some who believe that the amount of violence shown on TV and in the cinema affects the actions of our young people and increases the amount of violence in our society. I disagree with this statement and believe that there are other factors that contribute to the amount of violence in our society today.

Firstly, I believe that the amount of violence shown in the media is not the only factor that affects the actions of our young people. Other factors such as the presence of guns, poverty, and a lack of education all play a role in the amount of violence that exists in society. Furthermore, the media does not always portray violence in a positive light and can often be used to educate people about the consequences of violent behavior.

Secondly, I believe that the media can be used as a tool to reduce violence in our society today. For example, the media can be used to spread awareness about the dangers of violent behavior and to provide resources for those who are struggling with violence. Additionally, the media can be used to promote a culture of peace and understanding and to encourage young people to make positive choices.

Finally, I believe that the best way to reduce violence in our society today is to focus on the root causes of violence. This includes addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and a lack of access to education. Additionally, we need to focus on creating an environment where young people feel safe and supported and where they can access the resources they need to make positive choices.

In conclusion, I believe that the amount of violence shown in the media is not the only factor that contributes to the amount of violence in our society today. However, the media can be used as a tool to reduce violence in our society and the best way to do this is to focus on the root causes of violence and create an environment where young people feel safe and supported.
