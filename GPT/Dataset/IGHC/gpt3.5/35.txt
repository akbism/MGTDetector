The progress of science and technology has brought about a plethora of positive and negative effects. On one hand, the increasing popularity of computers and calculators has led to a decrease in student literacy. This has resulted in students becoming heavily reliant on technology for their studies and research, leading to a lack of critical thinking and creativity.

On the other hand, the progress of science and technology has brought about numerous positive effects. For example, computers and calculators have enabled students to access a vast amount of information and resources. This has enabled them to gain knowledge faster and more efficiently, while also allowing them to explore different topics and broaden their understanding. Additionally, the use of technology in classrooms has allowed teachers to better engage with students and create more interactive lessons.

Furthermore, technology has enabled students to collaborate and communicate more easily with their peers. This has enabled them to share ideas and resources, as well as work together on projects. Additionally, the use of technology has enabled students to gain access to a variety of online learning tools, such as language learning apps and online tutoring services.

In conclusion, the progress of science and technology has brought about both positive and negative effects. While it has led to a decrease in student literacy, it has also enabled students to access a vast amount of information and resources, collaborate and communicate more easily with their peers, and gain access to a variety of online learning tools.
