Immunization is an important part of a healthy life. Vaccines help in curbing spread of infectious diseases among children. Due to the advancement in medical science, parents now have the responsibility of making sure that their kids are adequately vaccinated against deadly diseases. Immunization not only prevents children from developing a particular disease, but it also helps in reducing the overall burden of serious diseases by creating herd immunity among people. 

Given the importance of immunization, should parents be obliged to get their children immunized? This is a highly debatable topic and there are two sides to it. On the one hand, parents should be responsible and be obliged to immunize their children in order to protect them from getting infected with dangerous diseases. Vaccination is a right of the child and if parents fail to provide this right, they are responsible for putting their childâ€™s life at risk. Moreover, if the child is unvaccinated and is spreading the disease, it can also affect other children in the community.

On the other hand, individuals have the right to choose whether or not to immunize their children. Some parents may have religious believes or certain other beliefs which may stand in their way of immunizing their children. It is their choice as to what kind of decision to take for their children and the government should not interfere with those decisions. If government forces the parents to vaccinate their children against their will, it can lead to great distress and unrest among people. 

Considering both sides of the argument, it is important to note that an obligation of immunizing child is essential. But, this obligation must be accompanied with proper education and information so that people can make an informed decision. The government should ensure that proper health care facilities and services are available to the people and vaccination should be made affordable and accessible. Moreover, it should be ensured that people are properly educated and aware of the importance of immunization and its consequences. 

In conclusion, while parents should be obliged to immunize their children in order to ensure safety, they should also be provided with sufficient information and support so that they can make an informed decision. It is only after giving proper thought to both sides of the argument, that one can come to a firm conclusion on this issue.
