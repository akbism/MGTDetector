It is true that people are facing more pressure in their work life than ever before. With the advent of technology and the ever-increasing competition, people are expected to work harder and faster in order to stay ahead of the curve. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of leisure time that people have to relax.

On the one hand, the pressure of work can be beneficial in many ways. It encourages people to stay focused and motivated, and pushes them to reach their goals. It also helps them to hone their skills, and to be more productive. Moreover, it can result in higher salaries and better job opportunities.

On the other hand, too much pressure can be detrimental to an individualâ€™s health and wellbeing. It can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression, and can even cause physical ailments such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and insomnia. Furthermore, it can lead to a lack of creativity and innovation, as people are too busy trying to meet deadlines and fulfill expectations.

In my opinion, it is important to strike a balance between work and leisure. We should not be so consumed by our jobs that we forget to take care of ourselves and our loved ones. We should make sure to have regular breaks from work and use our free time to relax and recharge. We should also ensure that we are not working too hard and that we are taking the necessary steps to maintain our mental and physical health.

In conclusion, it is true that people are facing more pressure in their work life than ever before. However, it is important to find a balance between work and leisure and to make sure that we are taking care of ourselves and our loved ones.
