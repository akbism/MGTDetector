In the last two decades, there have been considerable changes in the position of women in society. This has led to a situation where many married women are now working outside their homes, leaving their children to be taken care of by someone else. This has raised the question of whether this has caused the increase in juvenile delinquency among young people. In this essay, I shall discuss this opinion and explain my opinion on the matter.

To begin with, it is important to note that the increase in juvenile delinquency is a complex issue and cannot be attributed to one single factor. Factors such as poverty, peer pressure, mental health issues, and family breakdown all play a role in the rise of juvenile delinquency. Therefore, to suggest that the increase in juvenile delinquency is a result of married women working outside their homes is an oversimplification of the issue.

That said, it is true that the absence of a parent at home can have an impact on a child’s development. When a parent is not present, the child may lack the guidance, support, and discipline that are necessary for them to develop into responsible adults. This can lead to a lack of respect for authority, which can lead to delinquent behaviour.

However, it is important to note that the presence of a parent at home does not guarantee that a child will not engage in delinquent behaviour. There are many examples of children whose parents are present in the home but still engage in delinquent behaviour. This shows that the presence of a parent at home is not a guarantee of a child’s behaviour.

In conclusion, I believe that the position of women in society has changed markedly in the last twenty years and this has resulted in many married women now working outside their homes. However, while it is true that the absence of a parent at home can have an impact on a child’s behaviour, it is not the only factor that contributes to juvenile delinquency. Therefore, I disagree with the opinion that the increase in juvenile delinquency is a result of married women working outside their homes.
