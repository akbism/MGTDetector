Traveling has always been an integral part of our lives. It not only helps us to explore different places, cultures and customs, but also helps us to break away from the monotony of our daily lives and rejuvenate ourselves. In recent times, the nature of the average holiday has seen a substantial shift. According to those in the travel business, people are now seeking more exiting and challenging activities, rather than a relaxing break in a far-away place.

I agree with this notion to a certain extent. It is true that people nowadays want to experience something new and exciting on their holidays, rather than just lying on a beach or going sightseeing. This is mainly because of the availability of a plethora of activities that can be undertaken during a holiday. From adventure sports like bungee jumping, paragliding, skiing and river rafting, to cultural activities like exploring local cuisines and attending music festivals, there are a variety of activities that can be enjoyed by tourists. This helps them to break away from the mundane routine of their lives and allows them to experience something new and exciting.

However, I also believe that relaxation should be an important part of any holiday. While it is true that people now want to experience something new and exciting on their holidays, it is also important to take some time out and relax. This helps to rejuvenate the mind and body and get away from the stress of daily life. Therefore, I believe that a balance should be maintained between activities and relaxation on a holiday.

To conclude, I believe that the nature of the average holiday is changing, with people now seeking more exiting and challenging activities. However, it is important to remember that relaxation should also be an important part of any holiday.
