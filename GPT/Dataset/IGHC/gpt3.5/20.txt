I agree that schools should teach more practical matters such as home management, work, and interpersonal skills. Academic subjects are important, but there are many skills that cannot be learned from textbooks, and having knowledge of how to manage a home, work, and interact with others can be invaluable in the future.

First of all, home management is a skill that is often overlooked in school, but it is important to know how to take care of a home, from budgeting to cleaning. Knowing how to budget and manage finances, as well as how to clean and maintain a home, are important skills that are not always taught in school. Learning these skills can be beneficial in the long run, as they can help individuals become more independent and successful in their lives.

Secondly, work skills are also important and should be taught in school. Knowing how to work in a team, communicate effectively, and solve problems are all important skills that are not always taught in school. These skills are essential for success in the workplace and can help individuals become more successful in their careers.

Finally, interpersonal skills are also important and should be taught in school. Knowing how to interact with others, build relationships, and resolve conflicts are all important skills that are not always taught in school. These skills can help individuals become more successful in their lives, both professionally and personally.

In conclusion, I believe that schools should teach more practical matters such as home management, work, and interpersonal skills. These skills are essential for success in the future, and can help individuals become more successful in their lives.
