I disagree with the statement that students who study from school to university get less benefit and contribute less than those of students who go to travel or get a job and gain skills and experience before going to higher education. I believe that a student who studies from school to university can gain a lot of benefits and contribute more than those of students who travel or work.

First of all, students who study from school to university have the opportunity to gain knowledge and skills in a structured and organized way. They can learn the basics of a subject and then expand their knowledge and skills as they progress through their studies. This is something that students who travel or work cannot do. They may gain experience and skills from their travels or jobs, but they are not able to learn the basics of a subject and build on that knowledge.

Second, students who study from school to university can also gain valuable connections and networks. They can meet people from different backgrounds and cultures, which can help them build a strong network of contacts that can be beneficial for their future. Students who travel or work may not have the opportunity to meet people and build such a strong network.

Finally, students who study from school to university can also benefit from the resources available to them. They can access libraries, laboratories, and other resources that can help them learn more and develop new skills. Students who travel or work may not have access to such resources.

In conclusion, I believe that students who study from school to university can gain more benefits and contribute more than those of students who travel or work. They can learn the basics of a subject, build a strong network of contacts, and access resources that can help them develop new skills.
