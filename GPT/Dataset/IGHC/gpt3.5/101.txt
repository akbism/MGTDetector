The debate around the death penalty has been a long and winding one, with opinions divided on the morality of the act. This statement proposes that by punishing murderers with the death penalty, society is also guilty of committing murder, and thus life in prison is a better punishment for murderers. While there are arguments to be made for both sides, I agree with this statement to a large extent. 

The death penalty is an irreversible punishment, and thus by taking away the life of a murderer, society is indeed guilty of committing a murder. This is a valid argument, particularly when it comes to cases of wrongful conviction. It is not unheard of for innocent people to be sentenced to death, and in such cases, the wrongdoers are not only the individuals responsible for the wrongful conviction, but also the society that allowed it to happen. In this sense, life in prison is a much better punishment, as it allows for the possibility of the sentence being overturned if new evidence comes to light. 

On the other hand, some may argue that the death penalty is a necessary deterrent for serious crimes such as murder, and that life in prison does not provide the same level of deterrence. While this is a valid argument, it is worth noting that the death penalty has been abolished in many countries, and yet the crime rate has not seen a significant increase in these countries. This suggests that the death penalty is not necessarily an effective deterrent, and that life in prison can be just as effective in deterring potential criminals. 

In conclusion, while there are arguments to be made for both sides, I agree with the statement that life in prison is a better punishment for murderers than the death penalty. The death penalty is an irreversible punishment, and thus by taking away the life of a murderer, society is indeed guilty of committing a murder. Furthermore, the death penalty does not appear to be an effective deterrent, as evidenced by its abolition in many countries. For these reasons, life in prison is a much better punishment for murderers.
