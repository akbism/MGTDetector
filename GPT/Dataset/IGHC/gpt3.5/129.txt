Retirement age is a controversial topic with varying opinions on when is the right time for people to be encouraged to remain in paid employment. In some countries, the average worker is obliged to retire at the age of 50, while in others people can work until they are 65 or 70. This discrepancy creates confusion about what is the most appropriate age for people to retire.

In my opinion, people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment until the age of 65. This age is considered to be the age when people are physically and mentally fit to continue working. It is also the age when they can still contribute to society with their knowledge and experience. Furthermore, working until 65 can help people maintain their financial security and independence, which is especially important in the current economic climate.

At the same time, I believe that people should not be forced to work beyond 65. Everyone has different physical and mental capacities and they should be respected. Additionally, people should have the right to retire earlier if they wish and if they can afford to do so.

Finally, I believe that politicians should be held to a higher standard when it comes to retirement age. They should be encouraged to retire at the age of 65, as this is the most appropriate age for them to step down from their positions and make way for younger generations.

In conclusion, people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment until the age of 65. However, this should not be enforced and people should be allowed to retire earlier if they wish and can afford to do so. Politicians, on the other hand, should be held to a higher standard and should be encouraged to retire at 65.
