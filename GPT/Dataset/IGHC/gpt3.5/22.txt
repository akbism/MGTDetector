Nowadays, environmental problems are becoming increasingly prominent and have become an important topic of discussion around the world. It is true that these environmental issues are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. This is because environmental problems, such as global warming, air pollution, and water pollution, are issues that affect all countries, regardless of their size or location. Therefore, it is essential that the international community takes collective action to address these issues.

I agree that environmental issues are an international problem and must be addressed on a global scale. If individual persons or countries try to tackle environmental problems without the help of other countries, the results are likely to be limited. For example, if one country implements measures to reduce air pollution, but other countries do not, then the air pollution problem will not be solved. Therefore, it is important that all countries work together to find solutions to environmental problems.

Furthermore, many environmental issues are caused by activities that take place in one country but have an impact on another. For instance, air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels in one country can drift across borders and affect the air quality in other countries. This highlights the need for international cooperation to protect the environment.

In conclusion, I agree that environmental problems are an international problem and require collective action from the international community. Without this, it is unlikely that environmental issues can be effectively addressed.
