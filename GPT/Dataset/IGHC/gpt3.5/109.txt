The world has become increasingly globalised in the past few decades, and this has had a major impact on the way cities across the globe look. It is true that modern buildings often look the same, with a lack of cultural diversity in their design. This is a worrying trend, as it means that cities are becoming more and more similar, and their unique cultural identity is being lost.

The most obvious example of this trend is the increasing number of skyscrapers in cities worldwide. These buildings are often designed with a focus on practicality and efficiency, rather than on reflecting the culture of the society they are in. This is understandable, as the same design can be used in different cities, meaning that it is simpler and more cost-effective to construct. However, this means that cities are becoming increasingly homogeneous, with the same types of buildings in each one.

The lack of cultural identity in modern buildings is also having a negative effect on the people who live in them. It can lead to a sense of disconnection and alienation, as the buildings fail to reflect the culture of the people who inhabit them. This can be especially true for people who have moved to a new city, as the buildings may not reflect their own culture, making it harder for them to connect with their new home.

Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to address this issue. For example, governments could incentivise architects to design buildings that are unique to the culture of the city they are in. This could be done by providing funding for such projects, or by offering tax breaks to developers who build culturally-sensitive buildings.

In conclusion, it is true that modern buildings often look the same, and this is having a negative impact on cities across the globe. However, there are solutions to this problem, such as providing incentives for architects to design culturally-sensitive buildings. If this is done, then cities will be able to retain their unique cultural identity and the people who live in them will be able to connect with their home.
