Smoking has been a contentious issue for many years now, with some people advocating for a complete ban while others argue that it is a personal choice and should be allowed. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument, before concluding that a ban on smoking should be implemented.

On the one hand, it is argued that smoking is a personal choice and should not be regulated. This argument is based on the fact that individuals should be allowed to make their own decisions and should not be restricted by the government. Moreover, it is argued that banning smoking would be an infringement on civil liberties and would be difficult to enforce.

On the other hand, there are compelling arguments for banning smoking. Firstly, smoking has numerous health risks and can lead to serious health problems such as cancer, heart disease and respiratory illnesses. Secondly, smoking has been proven to be a major contributor to air pollution and can have a damaging effect on the environment. Finally, second-hand smoke is a serious health hazard for non-smokers, especially in enclosed spaces such as offices and restaurants.

In conclusion, it is clear that smoking should be banned. The health risks associated with smoking are too great to ignore and the potential damage to the environment is too severe to be ignored. Furthermore, it is unfair to subject non-smokers to second-hand smoke, which can have serious health consequences. Therefore, a ban on smoking should be implemented in order to protect the health of individuals and the environment.
