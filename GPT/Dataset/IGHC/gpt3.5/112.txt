Fashion trends have always been a major part of our lives and have been changing over the years. While some people believe that these trends are created to only sell clothes, others think that they should be followed. In my opinion, I believe that we should not be following fashion trends blindly and that we should dress in what we like and feel comfortable in.

Firstly, fashion trends are often expensive and not everyone can afford them. Furthermore, it is often difficult to find the right size and fit of the clothes from the latest trends. Therefore, it would be more practical and economical to wear clothes that we like and feel comfortable in, instead of trying to get the newest trends.

Secondly, fashion trends often change quickly and it is nearly impossible to keep up with them. Therefore, it is better to wear what we like and feel comfortable in, instead of constantly trying to keep up with the changing trends. This will also save us a lot of time and energy that we can use for other activities.

Finally, if we wear what we like and feel comfortable in, it will help us to express our personality and style. We will be able to stand out from the crowd and be unique. This will also help us to gain more confidence in ourselves and our style.

In conclusion, I believe that we should not be blindly following fashion trends and that we should dress in what we like and feel comfortable in. This will not only save us money and time, but it will also help us to express our personality and style.
