Today, there is a heated debate around the retirement age of senior workers. While some people insist that senior workers aged 65 or over should retire, others believe that they should continue working. In my opinion, senior workers should be allowed to continue working if they are willing and able to do so.

One argument in favor of forcing senior workers to retire is that it would open up job opportunities for younger people. This is certainly a valid point, as more job openings would provide better prospects for the younger generation. However, this argument ignores the fact that senior workers have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can be invaluable to their employers. They can offer unique insights, and can act as mentors to younger employees.

Furthermore, allowing senior workers to remain employed would be beneficial to them as well. Retirement can be a difficult transition for many, as it can lead to feelings of isolation and depression. Working provides a sense of purpose and belonging, and can help to keep senior workers active and engaged. It can also provide an additional source of income, which can be especially important for those who are struggling financially.

In conclusion, I believe that senior workers should be allowed to continue working if they are willing and able to do so. This would be beneficial to both employers and employees, as it would offer job opportunities to the younger generation while also providing senior workers with a sense of purpose and financial security.
