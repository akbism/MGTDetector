Sports is a form of entertainment and a passion for many. It is a field where success is determined by hard work, dedication, and perseverance. But, it is also a field where professionals can earn an enormous amount of money. While some people think this is fully justified, others think it is unfair. 

On one hand, there are those who believe that sports professionals deserve to be paid more than people in other professions. They argue that sports professionals put in a great deal of effort and time to perfect their skills and achieve success. They also have to maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay away from any form of doping or cheating. Moreover, they have to put in a lot of time and energy to stay fit and perform at their peak. Hence, they deserve to be rewarded for their hard work. 

On the other hand, there are those who think it is unfair for sports professionals to be paid more than people in other professions. They argue that there are many other important professions such as doctors, teachers, and scientists who make a huge contribution to society. These professionals are not paid as much as sports professionals, yet they are equally important. Hence, it is not right to pay sports professionals more than people in other professions. 

In my opinion, I think that sports professionals should be rewarded for their hard work and dedication. They put in a lot of effort and time to perfect their skills and achieve success. However, I also believe that the amount of money they earn should be proportional to the amount of effort they put in. People in other professions should also be paid a fair wage for their hard work and dedication. 

To conclude, sports professionals should be rewarded for their hard work and dedication. However, the amount of money they earn should be proportional to the amount of effort they put in. People in other professions should also be paid a fair wage for their hard work and dedication.
