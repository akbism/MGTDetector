In recent decades, the health risks associated with smoking tobacco have become increasingly clear. As a result, governments around the world have put in place laws that limit the sale and consumption of tobacco products. This has led to a debate as to whether the same laws should be applied to other substances, such as heroin.

On the one hand, it can be argued that the same laws should be applied to both heroin and tobacco. Both substances are known to have serious health risks, and so it could be argued that they should both be treated in the same way. Furthermore, it could be argued that the sale and consumption of both substances should be prohibited in order to protect public health.

On the other hand, it can also be argued that the laws should not be applied in the same way to both substances. Heroin is a highly addictive substance, and so it is necessary to have strict laws in place to prevent its sale and consumption. In contrast, tobacco is not as addictive, and so it could be argued that it should not be subject to the same laws as heroin. Furthermore, it could be argued that the sale and consumption of tobacco should be restricted, rather than completely prohibited.

In conclusion, while it can be argued that the same laws should be applied to both heroin and tobacco, it can also be argued that the laws should be different for each substance. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on the health risks associated with each substance and the potential for addiction.
