I disagree with the idea that non-academic subjects should be removed from the school syllabus in order to help young people succeed academically. I believe that these subjects are just as important for a well-rounded education and can be beneficial to a student's academic success.

Firstly, non-academic subjects such as physical education and cookery can provide students with the opportunity to learn important life skills. Physical education teaches students about the importance of exercise and the benefits of leading a healthy lifestyle, while cookery teaches students how to prepare nutritious meals. These skills are invaluable for young people and can help them to maintain a healthy balance between work and play, which can improve their academic performance.

Secondly, non-academic subjects can also provide students with a much needed break from their academic studies. This can help to reduce stress and give them a chance to relax and recharge, which can improve their concentration and focus when they return to their studies. Furthermore, it can also provide students with an opportunity to explore their interests and passions, which can help to motivate them to work harder in their academic studies.

Finally, non-academic subjects can also help to improve the overall school experience for students. These subjects can provide students with a sense of belonging and a chance to make friends and socialize, which can help to make school a more enjoyable and rewarding experience.

In conclusion, I believe that non-academic subjects should not be removed from the school syllabus as they can provide students with important life skills, a chance to relax, and an opportunity to explore their interests. These benefits can ultimately help to improve a student's academic performance.
